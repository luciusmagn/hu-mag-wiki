Once upon a midnight dreary,
while I web surfed, weak and weary,
Over many a strange and spurious website of hot chicks galore,
While I clicked my fav'rite bookmark,
suddenly there came a warning,
And my heart was filled with mourning,
mourning for my dear amour.

'Tis not possible!, I pleaded,
but my browser, so conceited,
Remained blank, I then repeated,
just a blank and nothing more.

With a scream, I was defeated,
for my cookies were deleted,
So i begged, no longer seated,
"Give me back my free hardcore!"
Then, in answer to my query,
Through the net I loved so dearly,
Came its answer, dark and dreary:
Quoth the server, 404

And the audience eyed, so bleary,
the net-Poe writ so clearly,
it could grow beyond just theory(!),
and they shouted "We want moar!"

Be that error message final in my quest for pics vaginal,
get thee gone from off my browser, take me back into the store!
Leave no breadcrumbs to remind me of the path where I did find thee,
take me to the pics of grindy women writhing naked on the floor...

And that server, not refreshing, still is caching, still is caching,
On that pallid page whose sidebars point to piquancy of yore,
With its layout laying rotten with a stylesheet long forgotten,
And the missing misbegotten image files that are no more,
And among those missing image files that I can see no more,
There is only... 404.
