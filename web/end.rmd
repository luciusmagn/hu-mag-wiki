"This place, it haunts me. Do you see the sky?
Clouded, only letting through a bit of orange light?
You can barely make out where the sun is.
Funny, me, looking for the sun...
There is no life here, this all is just gray dust and old ruins.
Everyone is gone... Everything is gone...
All the work, all the creation, just ground to dust.
And the hard bits collapsed onto one another."

"What is this place? What happened?"

"This is the end of the world. The end of our time.
This is all that the our efforts build up to. Dust and silence.
I don't know, what caused it. That's what terrifies me.
It means that this time, I wasn't a step ahead. Or maybe, I wasn't there at all.
Perhaps this threat has managed to finally free me from my mortal coil.
I just don't know. What if I was the threat?"

"I don't think you were, but then again,
I saw you as a very different person
just a short while ago. Question, though, why did you bring me here?
Also where's here, exactly?"

"We stand in a place that was once Europe, but
I have not examined the terrain enough to say where we are.
From our perspective, this is about four million years into the future.
Much can change in such a long time, even tectonic plate movement
needs to be taken into account, I reckon the plates have shifted roughly 2000
kilemeters, whichever way they were moving.

And why I brought you here, well... I am not sure if I can provide an exact answer.
I really wanted you to see this place, to take in the atmosphere.
Isn't this what many an artist would yearn for? You are still an artist, yes?
This is the pinnacle of man, the grand finale, the mark we left on the world!"

"Oh..."

"I also wanted to bring someone here, to share my knowledge of this place, and time.
You are the only one I think I can trust. Most people, they see a different image,
just one or two of the many facets I posses, but with you, I feel like me.
Like I can be honest even with the darkest of things. A feeling of not necessarily
agreement, but, nevertheless, a profound understanding..."

"I don't think I can be that, there's too much for me. And I'm not even talking
about you. I feel very strange, I am in constant pain and my emotions are a rollercoaster.
I still have trouble believing that this is actually real, that I am not in a mental
institution somewhere, drooling and talking non-sense. I'm sorry, I just can't cope."

"I assure you, this is the real world, but it's fine, I understand.
You don't need the supernatural to have trouble believing reality and yet here we,
we have that, everything seems outlandish and all the doubts are turned up to eleven.
But do not worry, I'll do my best to keep those worms out of your head.
You have been suffering in the dark for long enough, but now that era is over
and I think that everything will change for the better."

"Thank you... I wish too, it's just, this is all difficult for me.
I hope this is real, because if not, I am kinda fucked, you know?"

"It's fine, I understand. But you know what? Will you sit over there for a moment?
This is an opportune place. Looks like a satellite, must have fallen down from the sky.
When man perished, there was no one to check on it, or to maintain the technology running it,
for that matter."

"Okay.. What now?"

"Now, I sit next to you and tell you a story."

"What sort?"

"Well, the reality questioning kind. I wouldn't want to have you believing that
when I say I understand you, I am only being sympathetic."

"I know you probably aren't, but yeah, I sometimes think that you have too much in common
with me... Don't take it wrong, but it seems kinda odd."

"Well, when you have as long and as, uh... 'colorful', life as I did, you experience many
many diverse things and get into a lot of topics and areas that wouldn't all fit into a single
lifetime. Nevertheless, when you reach a certain stage, you realize that it's not really
the experiences anymore that make you who you are, but rather how you look at them.
You extrapolate a unique and consistent perspective. Anyways, I digress. Here's the story:

You see, I am still ultimately a pathetic being and there's a reason for that vertical scar
that's running down my chest. You know, that big one with the stitches, you saw it when I
was helping you recover.

So maybe one of my cohorts have told you about my generation. That there was few of us and
that we (mostly) predate even speech, and more importantly, that the coming of each of us was
triggered by an event. For example me and Kaine came when the first child and the first grown
up died, respectively.

One of us was missing - the one that controls the aether, which is a fancy time for the
space-time fabric.

Even though all of us first-gen freaks are shapeshifters, we did have genders originally,
and a simple head count revealed that the missing one should be female."

"How did you know there was a missing one?"

"We were somehow connected and knowing. Each of us had a purpose, sort of pre-programmed
into us. Even when I came about and woke up under a magical tree, I knew how many of us
should there be and what would be each of our designations. So like that.

Anyways, all the others have very neatly paired up and I was the odd one out.
Naturally, I figured that I would get along with the aether goddess when she'd appear.
But it didn't happen. I waited for years, looking for any trace I could find. There just
wasn't any.

That is, until the 6th century A.D. It finally happened. I received a message that she
has appeared somewhere in Asia. I was in the Middle East at the time. I knew that this
was important, because with how unique the aether deity was, she would be a great
target, all sorts of vermin would like that power for themselves.

Unfortunately, as my legendary luck would have it, I was weak at the time,
completely drained after preceding further unspecified events. So I was just having
a great time with a human friend, traveling around Middle East, helping him
achieve his goals and fulfill his dreams.

Long story short, I had to abandon him, pretty much overnight. I wasn't strong enough to
teleport or maintain more bodies, so I had to use more conventional means of travel.
It is my fault though, I spent too much time travelling the desert with my friend,
and well, that isn't exactly the biome that would help me amass my previous power, you know."

"I'm sorry... Did he at least understand?"

"Funny thing, I thought he did and it looked like it, when I was leaving, but turns out,
he lost his marbles instantly. He created a cult that was worshipping a twisted portrayal
of me and he became pretty radical, and not in the cool way.
Going against my morals in pretty much every department.

It was kind of sad, learning about all of that later. I still feel guilty, I didn't think
someone could ever grow so dependent on me. It's... strange... He did have a good life
otherwise though, so ultimately, I am content."

"Ah, what happened next?"

"Next, I travelled to Asia. I chased after the elusive goddess, but when I finally
discovered found her, all I got was a mangled corpse. I was too late, she perished at
the hands of man long before her potential was even discovered."

"Oh my god, that's horrible"

"It is. The thing is, so long as there are humans, there is a reincarnation cycle for
deities. You may reincarnate willingly, like I did not so long ago - and how I ended
up being one of your peers - and while it is a long and difficult, often life-changing
process, not to mention dangerous, you keep a sense of yourself. Your memories, general
looks, pretty much all that made you you. When you get killed as a god, however, your
essense gets dispersed. It takes a while to reconstitute and facilitate reincarnation,
but the person that you were would be gone. A completely different existence.

So this would happen to her. Many times. I eventually lost hope and stopped searching,
because I would always be late.
