# What Various Programming Languages Give You?
Every programming language has its pros and its cons, but they have
one thing in common: You need to give them your time, patience, mental
capacity, drive capacity and so on and so on. But what exactly do you
get in return? There are obvious things such as the ability to program,
fun, frustration, the programs. I'd like to, however, list some more
points for each of them.

## C 
C is a very old language,
but still widely used, which says something about its design. To this day,
C is one of my favorite programming languages. The main thing that C teaches
you is how things work at the lowest level (well, still above just pure assembly,
that is). Another benefit is that C is very fast, but you need to be careful.
It can possibly teach you how to do some things properly, memory-wise, but you
can also easily shoot your leg off.

## JS
Javascript is cardinal for web development. It also gives you insight into
how OOP with prototype works. The language is simple and very good for beginners -
you can just use it from your your browser! However, it comes at a cost. While
Javascript is still pretty fast, it is undeniably slower than compiled programming
languages. There is also a lot of weird quirks that you might run into if you
delve deeper.
