## About Me
Howdy, my name is Lukáš Hozda and I hail from Czech Republic.
I like programming, software development, compilers 
and programming languages in general. I can also do some web
development, but it is not among my main fields of interest.

The purpose of this website is to hold basic information
about me, some of my notable projects, my rants, some of my knowledge
and to work as a webserver paired with __Pebble__, a package manager for
the C2 language; __gjkbot__ & __rustgrade__, a bot and server for students' projects grading.

Feel free to check the sidebar.

Tada. If you want to add why Java
sucks, I am 100% merging.
