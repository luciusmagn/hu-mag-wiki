## Outer Heaven
Welcome to my humble abode. Please do stay a while. Thank you.

### Content
The purpose of this website is to hold basic information
about me, some of my notable projects, pieces of my crappy mythology and articles about.

The content falls under the following categories:

- Programming (mainly Rust)
- Social topics
- My mythology
- Stuff for my programming classes -> [RGJK](/rgjk)
<br>

Legacy versions of this website also served to view information
about the now-dormant C2 package manager, __Pebble__, and the two
experimental education oriented programs, __gjkbot__ and __rustgrade__.
