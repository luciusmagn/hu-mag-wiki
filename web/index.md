## About
Howdy, my name is Lukáš Hozda (unless you already noticed that from the sidebar ___\*cough cough\*___)
and I come from Czech Republic. I happen to like programming, software development,
C family languages, and well, programming languages in general.
I can also do some web development, but it is not among my main fields of interest.

The purpose of this website is to hold basic information
about me, some of my notable projects, my rants, some of my knowledge
and to work as a webserver paired with __Pebble__, a package manager for
the C2 language; gjkbot & rustgrade, a bot an server for students' projects grading.

## Programming languages
My favorite programming languages:
* __Rust__
* __C#__
* __C__
* __C2__

The other ones I used to use somewhat often. However, from the latter two, I can't say
I remember that much. They are past their primes anyways. It was good while it lasted.
Except VB. VB was agony.
* __Javascript__
* __Actionscript 3__
* __Visual Basic__

I briefly tried these and would be love to learn more, maybe.
Especially the functional programming is tempting. With Ceylon,
I really hope that the folks at RedHat finally made a JVM language that doesn't suck:
* __F#__
* __OCaml__
* __Ceylon__
* __TypeScript__

Used these in childhood, mostly faded away from my memory. Only good memories
remain. I really recommend Small Basic and NetLogo as entry languages for kids. Especially
the NetLogo turtles are lovely:
* __Small Basic__
* __Turbo Pascal__
* __Basic__
* __NetLogo__

The ones I'd rather forget and am doing a pretty good job at that, to be honest. These
ones are concentrated agony, I wouldn't wish upon anyone. Java is a tricky one,
because if you are learning it as the first language, you won't notice it sucks balls
until too late or until you are already brainwashed by it:
* __VB.NET__
* __Scratch__
* __Google Blockly__
* __Java__

The ones I think are not bad, but which I didn't give time. Might learn, but won't
be among my favorite ones for one reason or another. So far I like newsqueak the most,
it's a bit on the obsolete side, though:
* __Python__
* __Ruby__
* __Perl__
* __Newsqueak__

### Other computer languages
* __HTML__
* __CSS__
* __Jade aka Pug__
* __TOML__
* __JSON__ (does this even count?)
* __Rusty__ (I invented that one)

### Technologies
* __UE4__
* __Linux__
* __Windows__
* __Office applications__
* __MS Paint__
* __GDB debugger__ ♥
* __Construct__
* __Make__
* __Cargo__
* __CMake__ (just a tad)

### Editors
* __Visual Studio__
* __Notepad__ ♥
* __Sublime Text 3__
* __Micro__ (a very modern terminal editor)
* __Nano__ (the trustiest of compeers)
* __Sandy__ (fast and tiny in terminal)
* __ed__ ___ED IS THE STANDARD EDITOR___

### Frameworks/Favourite libraries
* __JQuery__
* __mpc__
* __ZedNet__
* __libc__ ♥
* __clap-rs__
* __reqwest__
* __serde__
* __libsl__
* __Pencil__ (SharpPencil fork)
* __Suckless 'arg.h'__
* __LiteDB__

### Things I wouldn't even touch with a stick
* __Java__
* __COBOL__
* __macOS__
* __iOS__
* __Anything Apple, really__
* __CS:GO__ (the people, not the game itself)
* __LOL__ (ditto)
* __DOTA__ (also ditto)
* __People who think programmer doubles as IT technician,
  "Hollywood hacker", sysadmin, mathematician, nerd and plumber__

Tada. However, I am the person who knows most about
me, so I don't know what might one want to add about
me here. If you want to add a juicy rant or why Java
sucks, I am 100% merging. Let the hate flow through.
