<small>(and am incompetent to express in person on the spot)</small>

<b>please, read this whole and don't skip/jump around because you might get a very wrong impression</b>

<b>also, I am a bit ashamed, awkward and worried about the consequences, have mercy, haha</b>

<small><i>i am writing this deep into the night, there are mistakes, i am tired and i am sorry :((</i></small>

Hello, I'm writing this with great issues, since I am not that great at expressing emotion,
and it is difficult for me, but I feel like I have to, to let the cat out of the beg and
because it's better in the long run. This is my ultimate high-school level display of honesty
and vulnerability.

I will start with one shameful historical admission. When we first got along back in sekunda
and tercie, you were one of my favorite people. Of course, as far as women went, I only had
eyes for the Kačka-Nella-Sára axis, but you were important as went.
However, I didn't really consider you as a girl, I had you as a gaming friend and a weeb friend
and if someone asked me what girl friends I have, I would have probably forgotten to list you.

I made many mistakes during that time and I regret most of them, but the one I regret the most
is letting you go back then. I feel like if I didn't let you drift away, or if I endured more
of what Artem and the lads (and later the girls) were putting me through, that I could have
stayed close to you and that I could have prevented some of the trauma you went through.

I consider it to be one of my greatest failures as a man and as a very keen people observer
because I know that even then, when I was miles back in my 'skills', that I could have noticed.
It makes me angry that what happened to you did happen and that it hurt you as much as it did.
Really, if I would get a chance with the people who wronged you, trust me that I would be within an inch
of introducing them to the GBH acronym.

Back then, when you went to the hospital for the first time, and I learned about what happened
to you, I was extremely sad. I didn't know why I was so impacted by it,
but now I think it was because I remembered how great of a friend you were to me and because
I realized that I could have done something about it, had I been more vigilant and more persistent.

Alas, I wasn't. Afterwards, I was quite happy that we started getting along again. It felt like
reconnecting with an old friend, and well, actually, it was. I loved how we would bully each
other and soft punches and stuff at school, it was fun. Around that time, we also started having
some lightweight conversations online and I liked that too. However, I am sorry about thinking
that "I had a break up" message was just a joke or a pun, haha, yea, my bad on that one...

Well, and then happened the coronatime. One day, you asked me if we would play Minecraft again
and I happily said yes. I thought it would be like old times, but in reality, it was much better.
We had fun, we had some deep talks about our lives and opinions (after all, we had a lot of
catching up to do!) and we started getting along more and more. Together, we fixed corona.
While most people consider the quarantine neutral at best, we made it a happy time.
I was more socially engaged in the quarantine than I was ever before. And, as far as seasons go,
it was the happiest one of my life. I know it probably didn't mean as much to you, as it did
to me, but I think it's important to point out.

Over the corona, I got to learn more about you and get closer to you. I learned about the things
you like, about your life, about the things you do, and how you feel and how you think and I
started noticing - wow, she is very much like me. I don't think I have ever seen a person
who would be at the core as similar to me. And it's not for a lack of searching, we are just
a very unique and weird type of person.

We got very close and we started having a positive effect on each other. I mean, obvious stuff
is obvious, no need to mention that again, but you, you did a lot more for me than I previously
let on. You took wounds I didn't know I have and you helped me overcome them (for example,
I used to have a huge block against sharing my food and drink and random touching). Thanks to
your presence, I was able to integrate some old bad stuff and I became a much happier person. When
I am with you, I feel a great sense of belonging, and inner peace. With you, I am able to talk
about things I could discuss with no one before, and all the discussions, questions, and answers
were enlightening to me. In comparison to the present, the old days without you seem dull and gray.
You brought light and color into my life.

But it's not just that. You are also helping me develop my artistic side. I always had strong
artistic urges, but I was, I guess, ashamed to express them because they didn't fit with my usual
persona and into my usual social circles. Not to mention that you motivate me to strive to be
better, more than anything else does.

And well, the truth is, as much I learned and got close, I was confused about you. You and your
presence was constantly attacking my old ways of handling emotion, relationships, and communication,
and my perspective changed significantly. It took me a long time to formulate and admit it given
my previous disposition for this type of stuff, but the honest, naked truth is: I love you.
I love who you are as a person, I love your art and your writing, I love your fashion, I love your
funky ideas, I love your humor, I love your quirky smiles and expressions, I love your beautiful
brown eyes and your unique face, I love your funny hair, and well, I love how you look as a whole.
Ye, basically I love you as a whole. And I hope this doesn't sound creepy or anything, I have never
told anyone this like that.

You are the closest thing to a soulmate I got. I consider you to be my soulmate actually.
You have just so much in common with me when it comes to the core. We are like two sides of the
same coin separated by drastically different life experiences and conditions. And I love that
about you and I am angry that yours were so harsh and damaging.

But, and I know you'd be quick to mention them to dissuade me, I realize and acknowledge that you have problems
and that you are not perfect (although you are not a bad or extremely flawed person by any stretch
of the imagination).
You see, I can see it with my cursed, sometimes seemingly all-seeing, eyes. You struggle a lot,
you were deeply affected by what happened and both your anxieties and PTSD shackle you like chains.
I can tell that you are downplaying it a little. And, you know, sometimes I see (I can see it in
your eyes and expressions more precisely), that an anxiety thought popped into your head at a
random moment and you are trying to dispel it. I can see how the PTSD affects you and how
its looming presence still permeates your life. I can see the inner struggle that's going on
and I can sense the suffering this all involved. I know that your brain stuff has the chance
of acting out much much worse than in the last few days. I've seen it in people and I dealt with
it before.

I know that you have poor decision-making skills sometimes and that you have a kinda shit people sense, yes
(and that horrible people stick to you).
I have also noticed that there is a child-like naivety to you sometimes. I know that you don't
like to think about stuff and especially about the consequences of stuff. I know that it's a coping
mechanism.

I am well aware that you are impulsive even in stuff that matters more than random shopping.
I know that you get attracted to things like a curious puppy and you don't realize some things
might bite. I can tell that you are sometimes in denial, or you indulge in avoidance. That you
are a chronic people-pleaser, that you don't like to listen to reason sometimes and that some
advice is more like a challenge to you. That you have trouble being mean and dealing with toxic people.
That, despite what you say, that you mainly get attracted to people by their looks and bad-boy status,
even though it may more than likely bite you in the end.

I know all that, and I accept it. I love you even with those parts and for your sake, I put up
with them, and I will do everything I can to help you improve in the areas which are most important
in the longterm. I have come to terms with them. I have come to terms with your mental struggle
and I love you despite that.

Also, everyone has a bunch of flaws, I am no different, I have some bits that just really suck,
yea, and I admit to them. I have trouble expressing some of my emotions, I can be annoying at times,
I am a bit lazy, I get lonely easily but I also avoid people, I can be pretty mean to people outside
my social circles, I have a dominating element and I have some odd random rituals
and bunch more. You can probably figure out some on your own, too. Yea, I am far from perfect.

Nevertheless, I promise to you, that regardless of anything, I will always be there for you in your recovery
and I will combat whatever demons you throw at me. If your anxieties act out, I will talk to
you until we have dispelled all of them, if your PTSD acts out, I will console you and I will offer
you comfort and my loving presence until its attack is over, if your depression acts out, I won't
let you sink to the bottom and I will make sure you are not struggling alone, if any of your medication
gives you some intrusive thoughts, I will combat them until they are all gone and fight to
force people to get you your meds fixed.

You are very special to me, I don't know anyone who is in my eyes as great as you are and, for the
sake of all the amazing parts of you, I am willing to confront all the darkness in you and in the world.
If that's what it takes, I will be your Scott Pilgrim (even though I don't think I can simulate
Cera's awkwardness well enough).

You see, you have done a lot of things which were so special to me, that you can't even imagine.
I loved it when you called me your husbando and jokingly said you would marry me. My heart jumped a little
when one day in Minecraft, you said that you'd maybe settle for me, that maybe you could use a calm
and stable partner like I am. When you were here in Chlumec, and you had your untouchy anxiety day
and you still awkwardly very lightly patted me, my heart fucking exploded because I knew that even
though you are struggling with anxiety that makes you really untouchy, that you still tried to overcome
it just to appreciate me.

Countless times, you said something that no one said to me before and what
made my heart melt. When you were drunk and you called me to tell me how much you like me and my
voice, I was ecstatic, especially since I used to be self-conscious about my voice. It made me blush
when you sent me the 'I think I have a crush on you' message. It made me so
happy when you did my eyebrows (it also made me feel and look a big bit more attractive).
Every photo of yourself you send me, whether it's a funky face or a happy photo
makes me happy too. It's why I wanted you to make me a funky Almink as wallpaper, to remind me
of our happy times.

And, I know that it was shameful for you and that you are maybe in denial about it a little, but what
happened in the forest made what I considered my icy heart burn like hellfire. When I held your hand and you were
next to me, I felt like I could do anything, and like there was nothing that could scare me or defeat me. I felt
happy and like I was 100x the man I usually am. And after the little kisses, I was so touched
I was on the brink of shedding some big manly tears. And I know that you would say that everything you
do drunk is to be disregarded, but in reality, research shows that when you are drunk, what's on the
inside and in the subconscious comes out. The fact, that there exists a small part of you that really
likes me and puts faith in me, even if it's tiny, keeps me going forward. I would do anything to cherish and protect you.

However, don't think I consider you to be a victim or weak or dependent or something.
Quite the opposite. I saw all the stuff that happened in your life and I know what you are like
and that is anything but that. You are very brave and very strong. Despite great adversity,
you push through. And furthermore, you even managed to have an aura that positively affects me, too.
And I love that about you.

I don't know how to keep this letter flowing nicely or coherent - it's just me writing what's on my heart
in one go at 4 am at night, but I would like to mention one final thing on this topic.
When I woke up on Monday when you were here and we had a terrible hangover, I saw you lying next to me.
Although you were kinda messy looking, missing pants, had a weird grip on both your and my blankets
and you were blasting my face with toxic hangover fumes, I thought: "This is the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen, I have to cherish and protect this with my life." Just seeing you the first thing
in the morning, maybe even more so because I was sick, was a really special moment for me.

And there is that. Like I said before, I would date you if I could, and I have never said this to anyone
before. This is because you are the only one I can predict having a longterm successful relationship with.
And I don't mean imagine or wish for (I wished for this stuff with everyone I met :(,).
Predict - because I make predictions about people and they are usually
completely correct. This is because we have very compatible personalities, similar in the characteristics that matter
if they are the same (introversion, conscientiousness, intelligence, quirks and habits, general outlooks)
and we are different in the characteristics that come from our life experiences and that we both should do
some learning.

That means, we have both much to gain from each other. You cure my loneliness, you make me more open,
you help me express myself better and you put my very industrious brain into motion, among other things.
I hope to teach you how to stand up for yourself, how to be more disagreeable and not be a people pleaser, I help
you develop your people sight (because I know you have it in you to have same keen and a little creepy
people eyes I do) and I hope to give you some of my stability, calmness and mental fortitude.
Not to mention I give you support and understanding and you give me the same. Also, there is the fact
that I have a lot of affection locked away that I could give and you are someone who would take a lot of it.

Furthermore, I know that you will be an even greater person soon-ish if all things go well.
If they do, I heavily suspect (and you can record this somewhere so you'll be able to see how right I was),
that by the time we are 25-ish, we will be both reaching our prime. If my knowledge and predictions work out,
I think that you will be mostly mental-issues free and only taking meds to correct the chemical imbalance
in your brain by the time you are 25. Me, I should have my feet kinda fully-ish recovered by that time,
so hopefully, I won't be living in a secret chronic pain (I wasn't joking about it back then, I really
am cursed like that, but the doctor said it should improve and that I will finally recover at about 25)
anymore and we will be able to enjoy ourselves at our fullest.

Also given that we have similar interests, like similar things, are pretty much conflict-free and
we both know how to resolve conflict, my estimation is that we would have been able to stay very long together,
if not until I die (because I will definitely die first - either my many health issues will catch up with me,
my values will get me killed, or my bad luck or just testosterone will kill me as it does to all men).
Not to mention the fact that we are very good and close friends. It is not a detriment, but a bonus and
very important in the longterm. Romantic stuff needs to be revitalized every few years and to have a firm
ground to stand for in the form of friendship is extremely important. Not to mention that in older age,
friendship is what will survive the test of time. It's what my mom told me and I believe her.

Well, the thing is that I made another mistake. I failed on more levels actually.
To be attractive to you, one needs both the right looks and the right behaviors. Despite what you say,
you actually care about how people look a lot. Whenever you are introducing someone in a conversation,
you always start with how they look, how hot they were or how weird-looking they were and that sort of stuff.
Whereas I usually shit-talk the new person's personality, which also maybe isn't ideal, haha.

Regrettably, I failed in that department. Over the corona, I became fat as fuck (I gained like 10-11kg for
fucks sake, a lot) and I was doing stupid shit with a crappy beard just because it was a good joke to do.
Meanwhile, I could have worked out, I could have shaved and I could have done more about the other bits
I struggle with, but I just didn't question my position and sat like a shitty potato. I'm angry at myself
for this and I am rectifying it right now so that it doesn't happen again. It's why I started excercizing,
signed up for fitness training at ČVUT, started eating/drinking healthy, and increasing my walk distance and running.
And yes, the running gets extremely painful at times, but I force through it
(I live in constant physical pain anyway and the doctor said it should be fine and actually improve).
You don't have to worry about this, it's just that I am a man of determination and commitment.

This brings me to my other issue. You matter to me so much that at the first sight of danger,
I changed my behavior a lot. You see, I am capable of the qualities you like in men. Usually, I am quite
disagreeable, I can be mean, I am an alpha (I dominate most communities I am let into), I am a man
of focus, commitment, and determination. I make mean jokes and nothing is off-limits to me.
I have a very strongly-defined and by me incorruptible moral codex. I am also
good with words and I can make people do what I want. I am a man of danger and ruthless action.
I am a man who makes meaningful promises and will keep them even at the cost of a great sacrifice
at my side.

But for some reason (one which might be quite clear, in retrospect), you completely disarm me.
I have real trouble displaying these types of behaviors around you. I don't want to say mean stuff
in your presence because I get worried that even though it's not directed at you, that I
might set off some brain stuff with you. With you I am more cautious about danger, after all, I don't
want you to be harmed by anything and because I worry that if something happened to me, that
you would be sad. I am actively undermining my position by being extremely nice and exhibiting
other behaviors that tank me. And so it resulted in you thinking that I am a pussy, that
I am not very manly at all, and devalues me as a person to you.

There is also another facet to me I neglected to mention before and that I am actually
brutally impossible to show you. You see, I have more in common with Kaiki Deshuu than I first
let on. I am also a great conman, I can manipulate people very well, I know just the right things
to make someone's day or to ruin them, I know how to lie effectively, and I know how to make people
like me a lot. However, I don't do these things very often, mostly because I feel evil and dirty
when I have an impact on people's lives like that. But, just like Kaiki, I mostly do it surreptitiously
to strangers for the sake of the people I love, and it will probably one day result with me getting
a bullet to my back. There is a tiny element of this in you too - that's why you like characters
like Kokichi - I believe. I may be wrong though.

And this leads to my first/second worry with you. I worry, that you will meet a bad person like that
and that they will take advantage of you, hurt you and set you back years in treatment. Or it may
just be a shit, hurtful person who doesn't really do this consciously. It's what
I really worry about - that one bad person could hurt your mental state. And I don't know what I would
do if something happened to you, I'd probably die inside. Because I love you and you matter to me
so much.

That is my other worry - just losing you in general. Ours is a chance encounter, we are both very
unique and yet uniquely alike (remember the two big lists of similarities - and they are nowhere
near complete, for example, I remember I used anger as a coping mechanism too when I was smaller).
I may never meet a person like you again. And you know that I have deep insight
into what's going on inside people. It is what helped me realize this. So I am worried that
I might lose you, that someone will do something to you, or that something tragic will happen.
That someone will take you away from me.

And I still have in mind what we spoke about in the Chinese restaurant. I know that it is real,
because I have seen people, I know people and I am very good at predicting what's going to happen
with people. And yes, you said that it's gonna be fine and that we would only maybe not do some
of the stuff, but the truth is, no offense, that's just wishful thinking. And I am not
putting you at fault - you have enough worry in the present and you don't like to think about stuff
because the conclusions you come to might both not be correct and bring harm/distress to you, so why would
you start worrying about the future, too? I get that, and I respect that, I know that to a degree,
that it is a coping mechanism and I know that there will one day be a time where you will be able
to consider the consequences of everything that's important and that will help you lead a happy
life.

But well, as I said, no one will stand my presence around you when we are this close.
And one can't drift apart just a little, it's a horrible slippery slope. So I know that you would
either turn away from me unconsciously or that you wouldn't and you the other person would put
you in front of an ultimatum, which would torture you to no end. And because I care about you so
much and I'd gladly sacrifice myself for your happiness. So yeah, every time you mention someone
as hot and dateable or say that you would like to date someone, I get a little jealous and worried
about the future, and I am sorry for that. I always do my best to not show it at all or let
it influence me, but I feel it every time. It's just that the time I spend with you is so
precious to me and I am anxious about the time these moments will end. If I could stop time, I'd keep
our moments forever.

This night, I felt like I was losing you the entire time. I was in great physical pain
and I was worried about everything. And sadly, you were too drunk or too distracted to see this.
It felt horrible.

There is an invisible noose around my neck and it's slowly tightening and it seems only I can see it. But if I would
know that it will lead to a happier Almink, I'd do a flip down the gallows right now. You are so unreal to me,
that it would be in place to wonder if you are not just a construct my mind created to tease me.
Alas, I don't believe in solipsism. I believe that things are real and that they matter,
even if it means that all the suffering is also real. Because it makes the good things also
real, and they are worth fighting for.

Long story short, I am willing to do things and let things happen if they make you happier,
even if it were to my detriment. Because you matter so much to me. I am would sacrifice all I
could for you if it were necessary.

...

Maan, I just have so many thoughts about you and I am unable to put it all into words,
but I think I should slowly start wrapping this up.

So, to conclude, I love you, mind and body, good parts and bad parts, I especially love the person
I know you have the potential and great possibility of becoming. You are special to me,
and you have a profoundly positive effect on me. I am sorry I failed you a few times,
I am sorry I started acting like a dingus in recent days and I hope that this letter will
be able to rectify it a bit, and so will my future behavior. I am a broad, wild person
and I hope I will be able to show more of my facets to you in the future.
I know, who you are as a person and how things might evolve, and even though it may
bring me trouble, I am willing to be there for you as long as possible and to support you
in hardships.

I have fucked up in my approach to you and I hope I will be able to improve, and that
I will be also able to become a fitter, more attractive person. All this so that I don't make
the same mistake and so that I may one day become the man you would have deserved.

I want to be around you. I want to have your heart always close to mine
so I can hear every throb of life, every sorrow, every joy. You are the only one for me.

This text is very risky and it was extremely difficult to express and open myself like this,
I hope you can understand that. It's just that I wanted to avoid bottling up stuff inside,
wanted to bring some things to your attention, and finally just organize and share my thoughts
and feelings.

Please, don't take my words lightly and don't just dismiss it as sweet little things,
because it's not lightweight. I mean what I say and fulfilling my promises is one of
my most important values in life. You have just become so important to me and
you found your way into my heart and vision, and there is just so much stuff that it
feels like it's impossible for me to just let out the whole truth at once.

Thank you, for reading this, and I am sorry if I said something that would offend you,
that you found creepy or if I did something that would hurt you. If I did, you are in the
right to punish me accordingly, I am prepared to accept whatever response you may have.
It's just - I need to let it out and I don't have any experience doing this.

Maybe it's the summertime. Surprisingly, it's the most difficult time of the year for me
because I am alone, secluded and people just kinda generally always drift away from me
during the summer, and it's very hard to struggle to keep them around when I am so far
away from them. Summer makes me a bit angsty, to be honest.

So, thank you, thanks for everything you have done for me, and thanks for being who you are,
thanks for being there for me and most importantly, thanks for making me your friend.

My heart is open and it's full of you.

I wish that we will both have a bright future together, regardless of the form it may take.
As long as my gaming waifu is happy, so will I be. In my eyes, for what it's worth, you
are the key to life on Earth.

Thanks.

Forever yours,  
Lukáš
