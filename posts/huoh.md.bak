> As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.

Turn the key, the engine kicks in and starts to whir. One last checkpoint before the destination.

Step on clutch, shift gears.

The massive armored truck starts to move. It's a heavy, colossal machine.
If you drive only a small car, then tough luck, you don't stand a chance against this monster.

Step on clutch, shift gears.

Trucks like these have many more gears than regular cars. It helps when going uphill, or when
the cargo is heavy.

The driver adjusts the rear-view mirror. One should only do this before the vehicle starts to move,
but there is no one and the truck isn't moving that fast yet.

The exit gate opens, the way is clear.

Step on clutch, shift gears. Repeat.

There is a small astronaut hanging from the rear view mirror. The symbol of man's greatest ambition.
Its head is comically large.

> You're going to pay a price for every bloody thing you do
and everything you don't do. You don't get to choose to not
pay a price. You get to choose which poison you're
going to take. That's it.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>STARRING</b></div>

As he drives, the man can't help but notice the slowly deteriorating quality of the road. The asphalt is faded,
cracked and there is the occasional pothole here and there.

Step on clutch, shift gears.

The road is completely empty, he can let loose a bit. Let's see if this tank can still go as fast as he remembers it.

It's winter, but there is no snow on the road, luckily. Or anywhere around, for that matter. In this region,
the winter has been particularly dry.

The road is less asphalt more earth now and so the twenty wheels start to leave a trail of dust and dirt.
From the behind, it might look like the aftermath of a sandstorm.

Step on clutch, shift gears. Foot slips, the transmission lets out an agonizing scream. The foot isn't as
sensitive and dependable as it used to be years ago.

The man turns on the radio. Right now, they are playing "Short Change Hero" by "The Heavy". It's a pretty nice song.

It speaks about running away from problems, a place ill-suited for a hero
and the perspective of the eponymous "short change hero". That is, an outcast and who possesses undesirable or unethical qualities,
but, despite that, tries to be the hero during difficult times and events, out of compassion or honor.

Step on clutch, shift gears.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>HORUS</b> AS THE LIGHT BULB SALESMAN</div>

> Life is suffering<br>
Love is the desire to see unnecessary suffering ameliorated<br>
Truth is the handmaiden of love<br>
Dialogue is the pathway to truth<br>
Humility is recognition of personal insufficiency and the willingness to learn<br>

The tachometer is approaching 80 miles per hour. This is slightly faster than what this road supports for this kind of vehicle.
The enormous cloud of dust is a testament to that.

Out of the truck, the driver notices that now and then, ruins appear in the surroundings. They are all sorts of buildings.

Some are large, some are small. There is one that looks like a convenience store. That one could have been a gas station.

One cannot help but wonder what happened, that would cause such strange, oddly lonely, ruins to be all around the place.

Nature calls, it's time to stop for a moment.

Step on clutch, shift to neutral. Lightly step on break, slowly come to the stop. It feels like gliding and it almost
evokes the notion that perhaps, this iron beast, has a little finesse in it as well.

Exit the truck. It's surprisingly windy here. The driver couldn't tell from the truck,
there were no trees or other vegetation that would give it away. Ruins don't bend to the will of the wind.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>NEIRO</b> AS THE ACCIDENTAL GUIDE</div>

As all men know, relieving oneself in windy weather requires certain positioning. Wind from the back is optimal and increases effective firing range,
but any angle that is outward is fine.

The driver stepped off the road and over the ditch, as he didn't want to sully it. It's already bad as it is.

Unzip zipper, ready, fire. Soon enough, the bladder is at peace once more. It wasn't the only thing at peace though.
There was something solemn about this place, as ruined and barren as it was, and the man felt that.

He sullied these hallowed grounds with the remains of the fluid intake of days past, it would make sense to honor it with something more
palatable, he thought.

Open the right door of the truck and reach in to the shotgun seat's compartment. He pulls out a box of cigars.

Calling the passenger seat shotgun is quite a strange phenomenon. It used to be associated with carriages and the
idea of a gun-toting partner in a reckless mobile shootout in the old wild West, but it's faux. It was invented by Westerns, it's a fake.

The cigars are, much like most things in the truck, a novelty. They bear the logo of one old game and in seemingly golden letters,
there is a sentence etched into them: "Kept you waiting, huh?"

Lighter out, open, spark, ignite, partake.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>???</b> AS THE SHADOWY FIGURE</div>

These are not great for your lungs. The man was well aware. His lungs breathed in much worse before, though, he thought.
This should be the equivalent of a fresh smelling rose garden in contrast to the past.

Some things stay with you for the duration of your life. A fair number of them stays in the lungs.

It took a while to get into the right mood. The man was no smoker, it was an occasional endeavor at best. Something to take the
edge off, once in a while.

All around, it was silent. All one could hear was the muffled sound of the last bits of "Short Change Hero" coming from inside the truck.
It was peaceful, and lonely. Long ago has this place been claimed the kingdom of genius loci.

As he put out the cigar and stored it away in his trench coat's pocket, the man noticed something flying in the wind towards him.
At first, it looked like a bag, the kind made out of linen or some other fabric, but the shape didn't look quite right.

The man stepped a little to the side, so he was right in the path of the flying object, and just as it was passing by him, caught it with his hand.

It was an apron. The kind that baristas, or sometimes bartenders, wear. There was some writing on it in the corner, but it was hard to make out
over the scorch marks that were all over it. The first letter the man could distinguish to be K. A K-something, then.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>FIRA</b> AS THE RAT</div>

Must have been a fire. Quite some time ago, if it was from the ruins. If it was from one of the cities, most probably the destination one,
it would still have taken months if not years for the wind to carry it this far.

> "No tree can grow to Heaven,” adds the ever-terrifying Carl Gustav Jung,
psychoanalyst extraordinaire, “unless its roots reach down to Hell."

This apron is an odd encounter, thought the man. And it was the kind of oddity that attracted him. A fine addition to his collection.

He gently folded it up and went to the back of the truck.

Unlock, lift iron bar, pull door open. Turn the lights on.

Everything inside was in order. He was a little fearful that his shipment of light bulbs might have been damaged by the reckless driving,
but luckily, no such thing did happen. It is a fragile cargoes, but if handled well, it will be fine even if a rocket hits the truck.

This container was much bigger than the ones that could have been commonly seen on cargo ships in the days of yore. It was about a meter wider
on each side, a meter and a half taller, and a meter longer than the standard dimensions.

This allowed for two floors to fit into the container, each of which was lined with shelves containing all sorts of things. It also provided
for quite comfortable living quarters when on the road.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>JAKE</b> AS THE PILOT</div>

After thinking for a moment, the man has found the perfect place for the apron and secured it with elastic rope. This, along with the fact
that the shelves were bolted to the interior walls of the container, ensured that nothing, that wasn't supposed to be moving, could move.

Close door, secure with iron bar, lock, pat the container as if to appreciate its good work. Time hit the road again.

> "Every bit of learning is a little death.
Every bit of new information challenges a previous
conception, forcing it to dissolve into chaos before
it can be reborn as something better."

Turn the key, the engine kicks in and starts to whir.

Step on clutch, shift gears. The beast starts to roll again. What a strange place this was.

He wonders if the way back will feel the same way, or if it will be "old news", at that point.

Step on clutch, shift gears.

Repeat.

The radio starts to only produce static, it seems like there is no broadcast the way he's headed.

No matter, there is still a lot of tapes and other media to play. The driver owns several a few boxes of just music.

Step on clutch, shift gears. Damn, all music is in the container. Staring at the road it is.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>&lt;MISSING&gt;</b> AS THE LADY OF THE RIVER</div>

Unfortunately, there is nothing interesting anymore.

Step on clutch, shift gears. Poke the astronaut. It swings from side to side.
It should now be only half an hour until the destination. Luckily, it doesn't seem like there will be a queue
at the entry gates.

Roll the window down a little, wind blows through hair and into the face. The man retrieves sunglasses from his glass compartment.
They are a novelty as well, of course. The temples of the specs are adorned on one side with a cracked skull and, on the other,
with a Rubik's cube.

An artist had them custom-made decades ago. The Rubik's cube is the representation of the infinity of problems, since there are thousands
times more configurations than grains of sand on Earth.

The cracked skull resembles the ancient supercontinent of Pangaea. It reminds of the last time
the entire world was truly connected and of the importance of connections.

> Loneliness does not come from having no people around you,
but from being unable to communicate the things that
seem important to you.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right">AND</div>

Step on clutch, shift gears.

The city finally shows up on the horizon. The walls are very tall and let off an oppressive atmosphere. Their monumentality
is a testament to the separating power they possess, of what needs to be kept out, or, more precisely, of what needs to be kept in.

Tiny hints of smoke can be seen over the walls. It's the houses trying to stay warm during the winter.

Finding a map of the city was a difficult endeavor, at best. One could only find rough ones, but the driver had a rough idea where he needs to go.
There is a parking lot for trucks next to the largely abandoned industrial area. And this was itself close to the entry gate.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>CPT. VOSS</b> AS ROCKET LAUNCHER</div>

Finally at the gates. There was no other vehicle waiting for entry or attempting to leave.

Shut the engine, remove key from ignition, poke the astronaut.

The man took his documents from the glove compartment. Details about his shipment and his newly assigned business permit.
The documents requested a three-day stay, excluding day of arrival and day of departure.

> One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light,
but by making the darkness conscious. The latter procedure, however,
is disagreeable and therefore not popular.

The man approaches the booth that governs the massive gate, behind which the city lights.

Freeze frame, stop.

Time to digress for a moment. I haven't properly introduced myself yet.

# INTERMEZZO: THE CARTOGRAPHER

I'm sorry for not admitting my existence earlier. I got completely absorbed in my attempt at story telling.

Very well, then.

Hello, I welcome you, dear listener. On this most auspicious of nights, let me recount a series of strange events that make a story,
one that I hope will be compelling, even if only a bit.

However, I must warn you - I'm a cartographer, not a writer or a storyteller, I work with maps and fact-sheets,
the telling of a story, despite being a newfound hobby of mine, still largely remains an enigma to me.
I cannot accurately convey the feelings, the oddities or the speech patterns of people I have never met in person.

I am still experimenting with some ways of dramatization and attempts to convey meaning and emotion, but for the most part, you,
dear listener, will have to read between the lines and infer the feelings and meanings yourself from context and the data I present.

Now, the data I'm privy to is very thorough and it records the events without a slightest hint of doubt, but it lacks life.
It's cold and hard and more suitable for a person like me, but not for a passionate listener, such as you are, undoubtedly.

Therefore, I try to withhold some information and present events in order which I hope might create a good story, with suspense
and meaning and flow. All that which you expect from a literary masterpiece, or a podcast or a movie.

So please, try to infer what's missing and extrapolate from presented data, and I wish you to get as much enjoyment out of this as I do.

This is a role-play of one strange cartographer, a man new to the waters of storytelling, so please, be gentle. In return, I will
try to make up for my imperfections with my virtues. I have got some items of interest prepared for later.

Alright, let's get back to it then. But first, let me retell two isolated events before we return to the main yarn.

The first one begins in the damp sewers below The City. The sewers have a rather complex and misshapen layout. This is because
they have to work around the three levels of underground that are in the city. Since the underground had priority, the sewers are crooked.

.

.

.

The sewers are a cold and damp place, a fine setting for a predator on the prowl, just as much as for a prey on the run.
The prey seems to be a little rat. Or at least, that's what they call her. She chose the sewers because she hoped they
would provide an escape from her pursuer, but so far, this hasn't proven to be a viable strategy.

She is scared, horrified even, and frantically running forward, taking the odd turn left or right.

Rat needs to stop for a second to catch her breath. The predator doesn't.

A tall shadowy figure, a strange man, without a doubt, methodically and slowly following the Rat's path.

One foot in front of the other, rhythmically, without a waver.

Left.

Right.

Left.

Right.

Left.

Right.

Like the beating of the drum.

The Rat is on the run once again. She tries to figure out where to go, but fear gets the better of her, and she just ends up running straight
forward.

Unfortunately, as is sometimes found in the predator-prey relationships of the animal kingdom, this is by design. The Rat doesn't realize
that she is slowly being cornered.

She hears the methodical footsteps of her pursuer, but she can't tell where they come from. It appears as if the origin of the sound was in her mind,
inside her skull, radiating outwards.

Left.

Right.

Left

Right.

Rat collapses for a moment, she feels like her head is going to split. Left. Right. Left. Right. After a moment, she regains some of her composure
and starts to run again.

Alas, her sprint leads to a dead end. This is why one should pay attention to maps and facts. Not knowing what you get into predicts loss,
preparedness predicts victory.

There is nowhere to run. Rat is terrified. She collapses to the ground and crawls back to the wall. Breathing heavily.

A tall shadowy figure soon appears. Left. Right. He calmly approaches Fira and extends his hand forward.

The man grabs her by the collar and lifts her off the ground. At first, she tries to struggle, but all resistance seems futile.
She can't bite him and clawing on his arm doesn't help, it is covered by a thick black overcoat. She gives up and remains frozen in fear.

And then, he speaks: "A little rat running around in the sewers, how fitting. I'm sorry Fira,
but I can't have you messing around with this place any longer." And as he finished the sentence, he let go of her, and as he did,
the girl disappeared without a trace.

.

.

.

Elsewhere, several days later. It is night, the sky is clear and the moon is full. Thousands of shiny stars silently glimmer. They are pure and far
removed from the troubles of earthly life. A million years ago, they were shining like this, and a million years later, they will still be there. Silently
shining, like tiny eyes, watching the world tirelessly.

The river is flowing north today. It has been many hours since the sun set and, as maybe unexpected of this city ridden with sin, the place where we are
now seems peaceful and quiet.

A naked woman appears. She has black hair, not too long, not too short. Her body is balanced, like the template for a fit female figure, although perhaps
tilted more towards the slim end of the distribution. Her eyes are red and the pupils have the stretch out over the iris in the shape of a triangle that
had its corners cut off.

The only thing on her is a tight black choker, roughly at the center of her neck.

It is not long since she was released from her master, firmly planted in the physical world, and out to do stuff on her own. There was still some adjusting
to do. Regardless, for tonight, she had a clear goal in her mind.

She walked towards the water and stood for a moment, then went in, until the water covered her feet. It was cold and strange. The cold didn't bother her.

She then slowly backed off and went in again, but instead of walking into it, she walked on the surface of water. There was a circle around her,
where the water was perfect still and flattened.

She headed towards the middle of the river, where the water is deepest.

The river started shining and changed color.

The woman still walked towards the depths.

The river started flowing the other direction.

No matter, even this didn't discourage her.

The river changed color and direction.

She finally reached the center, closed her eyes and laid down on to the water.

The river changed color, direction and again color and shone even brighter.

The woman took a deep breath and... sunk.

The river started changing color and direction rapidly, great waves appeared on the surface, it was like
an animal struggling to escape captivity. Like it was squirming on the ground.

This only intensified. The woman had sunk to the bottom already, like if you threw a stone into a pond.
She was squirming and reaching all over herself as well.

In a moment, the river seemed to have all colors at once and no one could tell which direction it was flowing.

Climax. The water stopped moving and turned black. It started getting colder and colder.

Suddenly, the woman rose out of the water, donning a black halter dress with a wide and ornate skirt, reminiscent
to those of ball dresses, but not as large as the ones you can see in baroque reenactments. On the dress,
there were several brooches, each of them was just a gem set into gold with a pin. One for each color of the river.

As she stepped on the surface, the water underneath her bare foot froze, so did the next step and the next.

The ice started spreading from her footsteps, at first slowly, but then faster and faster, until the water was frozen
as far as eye could see.

The red triangular eyes of the lady of the river were shining like two red moons.

She looked up into the sky, waved her hand over her head and said a single word.

_Mugetsu_. No moon. Starless sky. Eternal night.

Then she walked off, towards the nuclear power plant.

# EPISODE 1: HORUS

The man managed to park his truck in the parking lot for trucks and decided it was time to go for a walk and start exploring.

Elsewhere, but close enough, a short girl has just left the train to go to her friend's flat to drop off something for him.

The sun is shining and a cold, wintry breeze is blowing. The girl is absentmindedly walking on the sidewalk. She remembers an
event from a few years ago which changed her life forever. She is unsure why, perhaps it's the trucks that are driving by on
the road.

As it happens, the man is on the other end of the sidewalk. Two strange fellows are about to pass by one another.

There is still a bit of ice on the sidewalk. It's a leftover of snow from a few weeks ago. The winter has been dry indeed.

The nostalgic daydream of the girl doesn't pay off. She trips and falls right in front of the man.

The man, looking about thirty-five, well-built and muscular, brown-haired, with a skin slightly darker than that of a typical white man,
and with piercing blue eyes stops in front of the fallen girl.

He is surprised, but grabs her by her coat and helps her get back on her feet. She growls angrily.

Then the man spoke:

"Howdy, are you alright? My name is Horus, that's H-O-R-U-S, not Horace, some people confuse the two. And you are?"

"I'm Neiro... thanks."

"Glad to meet you, I'm new to this place, so I don't know how stuff works around here yet."

"How did you get in? They don't let people without a resident card in," Neiro responded. Or something like that, I'm still unsure about the way she speaks.
Cartographer insert out.

"I have a business permit. I am a businessman of sorts. I sell light bulbs and I also have another passion. I adore trinkets and oddities and
I trade for them. I heard there is a lot of strange stuff going on around here, so I came over here personally in hopes of finding some interesting
things... Ah, I'm sorry I talk too much. I have been on the road for quite a while."

Neiro commented on how strange Horus's vocation seems to be, but decided to bid him farewell and go on her merry way.

Horus, however, stopped her and added: "Actually, I'm looking for someone to show me around, you know this city, don't you? Would you
be willing to be my guide?"

Neiro shook her head and declined as politely as she could. She felt a little cranky and wasn't in the mood for some strangers.

Horus presented a counter-offer: "I'm paying". He was a pretty successful businessman with a lot of coin to spare.

An image of a wallet full of only cobwebs flashed through Neiro's mind. Maybe she could use a little extra money,
even though she knew she would be broke again quite quickly anyway. Horus looked well kempt and didn't look to Neiro like the type
to go murdering in a dark alley.

"Okay, I will show you some places, but don't expect much. This city is a dangerous shit hole. Also don't be weird."

"Alright, you have my word. Where do we go?"

"I have some errands to run."

"That's fine, what place are we visiting first?"

"My friend Valentine's house. I got something for him."

"Would that happen to be one Valentine Erimez?"

"Yes...? Do you know him!?" said Neiro, slightly concerned. The fact that he knows Val's surname shook her a bit.

"No, I don't know him. Not personally, but I have a shipment for him. Actually, let's take a two-minute detour to my truck,
we will pick up the package, and then we can kill two birds with one stone, how about that?" Horus responded.

"Uh, okay. What do you have for him?"

"This might surprise you, but light bulbs. It's not a big package, only six of them. He is one of the three customers
thanks to whom I have been able to enter The City." Horus explained.

"Why would he order light bulbs from you if you are from so far away?" Neiro was still more than slightly suspicious.

"I make light bulbs like no other. I have a wide assortment of illumination devices for all sorts of use-cases.
You'll see in due time."

Strange.

And so, Neiro and Horus took a detour to the truck parking lot. He showed her his truck, it was a bit scary to her,
not just because it was oversized and armored but also because although the color is different and modifications have been
made to it, the cabin looks like the very same truck that appears in the dreams she has every once in a while, the one
that hit her.

Horus tried: "Look at her, this beautiful beast. This is the best truck ever made, it can deliver anything anywhere
and it's protected, there is no safer place than behind this ship's steering wheel."

It did not help.

"It's my mobile command center, haha. I have a lot of trinkets, oddities and novelty in it. Surely there will be something in it
you'd like."

"No, let's get out of here."

That was it, then. The two made their way towards Valentine's flat.

Neiro knocked on the door and in a moment, Valentine opened the door. He was a black man, with dark-looking eyes,
about the same height as Horus, slim but definitely fit.

Neiro immediately hugged him. She was very cranky before, but now she was excited to see him.

"Look, what the cat dragged in. I'm glad you came, Nei-rou," said Valentine with a smirk.

"Who is this other guy, N?" he added.

"I'm Horus, I have your light bulb shipment. Ampoules Sans Frontiéres Pvt. Ltd.," responded Horus with French
that sounded more like German.

"Uh, Neiro, this isn't the guy was supposed to make the delivery," said Valentine and readied his hand to grab for his dagger,
if it were necessary.

"That is correct, I'm not your local delivery man. I'm the manufacturer, my company produces these.
We accepted a few orders to The City, so I took the opportunity to visit and see it for myself. Sorry for
the misunderstanding. Here's your light bulbs," replied Horus, handing the box to Valentine.

"Okay, then, thanks."

"Pleased to meet you, like I said, my name is Horus. That's 'US' at the end.". Horus extended his hand to shake
Valentine's.

"I'm Valentine."

Valentine shook Horus, but as he did, Horus squeezed his hand as to not let him go and turned Valentine's hand
knuckles up.

"Fancy tattoos, I have never seen any like these before. Do they carry some deeper meaning?" asked Horus curiously.

"Depends, they have meaning for me," says Valentine, shrugging.

"I understand, well, all I can say is that I dig the skulls," responds Horus with a slight friendly smile.

"We should go," Neiro joins the conversation.

"We will talk later, Neiro. Be careful."

"See you, Val."

Neiro and Horus leave. On the way out, Horus asks:
"I couldn't help but notice that your right eye is in a pretty bad shape. You can't see out of it, can you? What happened?"

"No, I can't and it's a long story," responded Neiro, with a slightly angry undertone.

"I see. If it's any consolation," said Horus, "my right eye doesn't see that well either. In my case, nothing happened. It's
been like that for as long as I can remember. So my eyesight isn't that good, but I try to make up for it by making the most
of what I got, by paying attention to things."

A single "Huh" comes out of Neiro as she takes out a cigarette and a lighter. She puts the cigarette in her mouth.

Lighter open, spark, flame, ignite... wait, what? Where is the cigarette?

Neiro snaps out of it and sees that Horus snatched it.

"These are bad for you, you know?" he exclaims.

"Give it back, are you gonna school me about the dangers of smoking!?" says Neiro angrily.

"No far from it, what I'm saying is, these suck," he responds as he throws it away. "I believe... that quality is preferable."

Horus pulls out the cigar from earlier out of the breast pocket of his trench coat.

"Try this, it's better and less cancer. And of course, it's a novelty. See the writing on the side?"

At this point, it only said "you waiting, huh?", the front of it has been burnt off already, still, there was about two
thirds of it left.

"You know how to use it, right?" asked Horus.

"Yea, what did you think?" Neiro was still a bit hostile, but she snatched the cigar out of Horus's hand.
She was angry, but also curious, since she never smoked a cigar before.

Lighter open, spark, flame, ignite, partake.

Neiro immediately starts coughing and wheezing.

Horus starts laughing: "It seems your prowess has been overstated a bit. You don't inhale a cigar like a cigarette,
you will just start coughing and have a bad time. Also, there is ten to fifteen times more tobacco in this than
in a cigarette. Moderation is key."

"Here, imagine that you are pulling in from a straw, that's a good way to think about it. You pull in, you let
it sit for a moment and then you blow it out. But don't do it that often, or the cherry will get too heated and
you will start tasting tar."

"Okay, alright." Neiro was embarrassed about her smoking failure.

She tried being more gentle and doing it the way Horus said. It was much better. Unlike the cigarettes, which she
was mostly smoking to take the edge off and to satisfy her addiction, this thing tasted pretty good.
It was actually a pleasant experience. She finally calmed down and daydreamed again.

She pulled in and blew out smoke a few times and then returned to paying attention.

"So.. these light bulbs you are selling, what are they for?" she asked.

"I sell a plenty of types. If you are asking about the ones for Valentine in particular,
those are weed bulbs. They make weed grow better."

If Neiro was drinking coffee right now, she would have spat it out. Unfortunately,
it was just a single cough and a fast exhale: "What?"

"Well, exactly that. They have a specifically calibrated color which emulates just the type of daylight you need
for optimal growth. But, I make many more types of illumination devices. Bordering between shady and legal business
is not all I do."

Neiro, was still a little surprised, but it made sense. She pulled in the cigar again, blew out and said:
"Okay, and what's a cherry?"

"... the burning part of the cigar."

# EPISODE 2: JAKE

> My soul, where are you? Do you hear me? I speak, I call you -
are you there? I have returned, I am here again. I have shaken
the dust of all the lands from my feet, and I have come to you,
I am with you. After long years of long wandering, I have come to you again.
Should I tell you everything I have seen, experienced, and drunk in?
Or do you not want to hear about all the noise of life and the world?
But one thing you must know: the one thing I have learned is that one must live this life.
Do you still know me? How long the separation lasted! Everything has become so different.
And how did I find you? How strange my journey was!
What words should I use to tell you on what twisted paths a good star
has guided me to you? Give me your hand, my almost forgotten soul.
How warm the joy at seeing you again, you long disavowed soul. Life has led me back to you.
Let us thank the life I have lived for all the happy and all the sad hours, for every joy,
for every sadness. My soul, my journey should continue with you.
I will wander with you and ascend to my solitude.

Elsewhere, some time earlier.

Jake was, by all accounts, an ordinary man. He was born and lived most of his life
in Yatoru, working several odd jobs and trying out all sorts of different careers.

He was by no means an uneducated man, but, for some reason, simple, manual jobs
like these were relaxing for him.

In school, he was above average in technical subjects, humanities didn't speak to
him too much.

When he reached adulthood, he first obtained a regular driver's license,
then he went for trucks and buses, and eventually, he even learned how to fly
a helicopter.

Jake has always been a wayward spirit. He moved away from his parents at the
age of twenty and was constantly looking for jobs where he could travel
to a different city, or see things he hasn't seen before.

One fine day, he found an interesting job posting in the newspaper. It was a chance
encounter, really, he didn't really read the newspaper otherwise. It was rather cryptic
in its omission of details, but it promised the things Jake was looking for.

Travel to a different city, fly a helicopter, variety of manual jobs. Like a contractor
and pilot amalgamation. There was a phone number underneath the ad, so he tried to call it.

The person on the other end sounded excited and positive and invited Jake for a interview.
A few days later, Jake went for the interview. It took place in a rather large office building,
it was a little hard to orient oneself in the corporate setting.

Thanks to pointers from the people working there, he was eventually led into an office with
a nice view over the city.

It was winter, so the scene wasn't as vibrant as in, say, spring, but it was a nice sight
nevertheless. One could see hundreds of people moving around and going about their daily
lights, cars driving around, as if they were little bugs looking for food, and houses,
churning white smoke from their chimneys like a person breathing on their hands to keep them
from freezing.

The winter was dry and there was almost no snow, only some icy remnants on the sidewalk.

> If we feel our way into the human secrets of the sick person,
the madness also reveals its system, and we recognize in the
mental illness merely an exceptional reaction to emotional problems
which are not strange to us.

The office apparently belonged to a blonde woman. She looked to Jake about 170cms high,
she had blue eyes and a far more fit, perhaps even muscular, build than one would expect
from a high-ranking office executive.

What looked strange to Jake was that she, despite clearly holding a high position, looked
very young. If he really stretched his imagination, he would say thirty at best, but that would
be one foxy thirty-year old!

The woman shook his hand and introduced herself: "Hello, my name is Eir, welcome to Morpho Inc."

Jake responded: "Ah, hello, I hope I'm in the right place. I'm Jake. I'm sorry, I think I misheard you,
did you say your name was Eir?"

"Haha, yes, that's my name. My parents were of nordic descent. This name was quite common in the country
where they came from. It's like the name Mercy was in US."

The interview followed next. Eir asked Jake for some details about his life, verified that he
has no stains on his criminal record and overall did her best to establish that he is good for the job.

"What job was it anyway?" you might ask. Well, as she explained, the company wanted to establish a
forward operating base in a city, which she said "was not that far". His job would be to occasionally
move some cargo over the city with a helicopter, help with some manual tasks and with organization.
Further details on-site.

Jake was a little suspicious, but his curiosity and his adventurer spirit got the best of him. He said yes.

Finally, the woman added: "Oh, and you might see some strange things. They could look supernatural
or out of this world, or outright scary sometimes, but don't worry, there is nothing to be concerned about.
Oh, and the boss, he will be there leading the operation, he is a little eccentric, don't be alarmed. Is that fine?"

Jake was processing this for a second, then responded: "Meh, I guess so." The pay was very good
and the woman even made a promise that there will be a sizable bonus if everything goes well, so Jake
thought, given the fact that he didn't believe in the supernatural, that this will be fine.

Lastly, the woman added: "Thank you, I'm glad we can do business. Now, here is the place where you need to travel to,
from there, we will provide the transport to the city. If you retain your receipts,
we will cover the travel costs. Also hand in this paper at the receptionist, they will hand you your work overalls
and a complimentary company baseball cap. We might meet at the site, but I will be arriving later, if at all."

Jake spotted an opportunity and said, with a suggestive smile: "We can meet over a drink later, too, if you want." Wink.
It wasn't very effective.

Eir responded: "Well, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid I must decline. You see, if you go drinking
with a nordic blood, you must have started off with the worst handicap ever. I have no interest
in dragging young drunk men from under the table... Again."

Jake was a little disappointed that his attempt failed, but no matter,
"You miss one hundred percent of the shots you don't take," he thought.

> To venture causes anxiety, but not to venture is to lose one's self....
And to venture in the highest is precisely to be conscious of one's self.

The two bid their farewells and Jake returned downstairs to the reception, where he picked
up his new outfit. Both the cap and the overalls were dark blue with a single red stripe on each side.

He was told that he is the last new employee to be accepted and that everyone else is already there.
The instructions were to come as soon as possible, so he returned home, packed a modest backpack and
left his flat first thing in the morning.

Interestingly, the coordinates he was given led to a abandoned farm field, not far from The City.
Jake was quite surprised, he heard about the city before, but had no idea what to expect.
There were apparently some stories about strange events taking place in the city, including a great
fire that nearly led to its destruction not too long ago.

He took a bus as far as he could, near the edge of the ruins and then he had to go by foot. Yatoru
has not established public transport to The City walls, so one could either travel to a gas station
near a smaller city called Gan Adfeilion, which was about two thirds of the way,
and walk the rest, or go to Korubon and then hitchhike
with one of the drivers who ran a supply chain to the distribution center in southern City.

Jake opted for the first option, since it was a few hours shorter and less risky than traveling with
a stranger. People who dealt with The City had less than favorable reputation.

Going to the designated place took several hours. Since it was winter, the days were quite short,
so before Jake arrived at the destination, the sun had already set.

At first, he thought that he was seeing wrong, but there was a man standing in the midst of the ruins,
he was facing the other way, towards the walls.

He wore black formal shoes, dark grey pants, a black overcoat and a wide brim fedora.
He was slightly shorter than Jake, but not by that much.
Thanks to the dark and the hat, it was hard to make out what he looked like.

Jake tried to approach him, when suddenly the man turned around and yelled: "Jake?"

Jake twitched, he was shocked a bit, but after a few seconds responded: "Yes?"

"Hey, I've been waiting for you, come closer," the man said cheerfully and waved at him.

Both of the men started moving to the other, soon enough, they were face to face.

"Hi, glad you're here, Jake. I'm the boss. You will be working for me now."

The two of them shook hands.

"Hello," responded Jake, "am I in the right place? It seems kinda ruined around here,
to be honest."

"Yes, this is the correct place. Now, I will tell you where you need to go next.
And I also got your first assignment. You get to fly a brand-new helicopter. It's a Sikorsky H-60/S-70,
utility line. Decommissioned without having taken a single trip before we got to it."

"Hey, that's pretty cool. Isn't that a military helicopter, though? From a different continent, no less?"

"It is, but if you got coin, you can buy them when their 'tenure' ends. We managed to find one
which was just sitting in a warehouse."

"Oh, man, that gets me excited, then, haha," Jake responded in a cheerful tone. "Well, it's a still strange just
standing like this in the dark around some ruins, but this nice helicopter really gets my hopes up."

"Ah, I'm afraid that this is not the end of strange things you are going to see here, heh. Anyways, to your
task. You will arrive at our camp, in an empty area west of the nuclear power plant. We have set up camp there.
There, you can relieve yourself of your backpack and go to sleep. By the next day, the others should mark a heliport
near the camp, so you know where you will have to land.

In the morning, go to the provisions officer, he has a yellow
tag on his back and will probably be running around, distributing equipment, can't miss him. He will give you
a parachute, a helmet and a handgun. The City is dangerous at times, so this is just an insurance in case you'd
need to defend yourself.

You will travel to the other side of the city, to the distribution center. That's where the helicopter
is landed, and it's also where you will meet your co-pilot. They will already be waiting for you. The
staff at the distribution center will attach a large pallet - and it will be also wrapped in a net - of cargo
to the helicopter. Your task will be to take your co-pilot and fly all those supplies to the camp back near
the power plant.

I recommend high altitude, for safety reasons."

Jake nodded his head and said: "I get it. I'll do my best, boss. By the way, can I ask your name? Also, how
do I get into the city, to the camp?"

"Well, you can ask, but I'm afraid I can't give you an answer at this time. Later, sure,
when we have our feet on the ground, but not now.
There are people, who would be none too happy about my presence in The City, and I can't risk someone
will be out to get me before we will have even set up shop."

"Whoa, that sounds dangerous. It feels more like an action movie than a company expansion!" commented Jake.

"Nooo, but it feels like that sometimes, haha. Now, let me be frank with you. There is a military aspect
to our operation, and we need to do some stuff which seems sketchy to the outside observer, but don't worry,
nothing of that is on you. Got it?"

"Uh, alright, I'd prefer to stay out of too much danger, though, if you get me. How sketchy are we talking?"

"Militaristic, weaponized. You'll see. Now, I know what I just said sounds scary, but I was being forward.
Need to cover my bases, you see. Even with employees. I want none of you hurt or shocked or anything.
Everyone has been briefed on what concerns them."

"I see, well I'm curious and a little frightened, not gonna lie."

"I understand that, of course, but you have my word. Not to mention, I can really make this worth your while.
Apart from your payment, I can offer you a golden ingot. Real one, twenty-four carat gold. This might sound
old-fashioned, keeping gold, I mean, but have you seen the prices lately? The last great war used up
a great portion of the world's gold reserves on weapon electronics. Lower supply, bigger price. Let it
sit for a few years and you'll be rich," the boss added.

"Alright, thanks, I'm not really in it for the money, but thank you. Sounds like a rare keepsake to me,"
said Jake.

Jake suddenly heard a strange sound, as if something was dripping.

The man continued: "Oh, I nearly forgot, you asked me how to get into the city. Well, you see the walls,
they are a few minutes away, but they look tall already. So just go ahead towards the walls and you will
get there. Don't worry about anything. Trust me."

Jake listened, but he was trying to locate the source of the dripping. Aha! There it is.

"Uh, Boss, I think you're bleeding from your left hand." Dark droplets were slowly dripping onto the ground.
There was either very low oxygen content in the blood, or it was mixing with some other color.
Maybe the coat? Maybe the hands were dirty, it was possible he was touching some machinery and
got some tar or pitch on his hand. Something like that.

"Oh, that, yea. It will be fine. I guess it's the price you pay if you rush things, haha. Slow
and steady, they say, slow and steady... Anyways, you better get going, same goes for me. I need
to run one more errand first, so I'm going back to my car, it's parked on a road nearby. See you around,
Jake."

"Okay, goodbye, boss."

This was a little perplexing. Jake tried many strange jobs, but not a single one of them began like this.

He started walking towards the walls. It started to get windy.

His path was blocked by a dilapidated bridge. Adjust backpack shoulder straps, examine the obstacle. Climb over it.
Look around at the top. Ruins all around. Wind blowing.

He took out an energy drink from his backpack. Refreshing, recharging. Start walking again.

Wind intensifies. You can hear it whistle through the buildings. Clear sky, more stars appear.
The moon is nearly full.

Wind intensifies. He tries to figure out a way which uses the ruins as a cover. It only helps a bit.
The ruins provide less and less cover the closer you get to The City.

Wind intensifies. It's a warm wind. Unusual for winter. A lot of dust is lifted off the ground,
making it harder to see.

Again, wind intensifies. Jake can't stand it anymore, he has to close his eyes and cover them
for a moment. He reaches behind and tries to blindly search for his sunglasses. Should be somewhere
near the top of the backpack. Can't find them.

The wind starts to slow down. It gets slower and slower, soon enough, it's just a breeze with an occasional
stronger gust.

Jake opens his eyes. He is elsewhere, there are no ruins around him. He can see the camp a few hundred feet of him.
To his right is a nuclear power plant. Wall is behind him.

"What the hell?" he says to himself. He adjusts his backpack and goes to the camp.

There is a few dozen people at the camp. They are wearing similar overalls as him, but the stripes
have different colors or positioning. There is one woman which has two white stripes on one side, none
on the other.

There is also a lot of people in combat gear. They are in all black and are wearing masks. Not a single
inch of skin is showing. They are just idly standing around. Sometimes, one of the overalls points at
a crate or some object and shouts a command and a few of these pick it up and carry it where requested.

Jake walks to the camp. Several people say hi to him. He responds likewise. He can't tell where to go.

Suddenly an older man waves over at Jake, it's the provisions officer. He welcomes and apologizes that
the camp is still in chaos. "We're only just setting up," he explains. He beckons Jake to one of the tents
and hands him the items. Also, he gives him a map of the city.

"I know you were probably expecting to pick these up in the morning, but we are in a kind of
hurry here, so I'm just giving you the stuff now. Also, you will need these for your way to the
distribution center." He hands him a card and some change. "The card is so you can use the trains,
the change, just in case. Or buy yourself a lunch, I don't care."

Jake is a little confused by the chaos that's going all around him, but he thinks, "fair enough,
it's the first day, this is all to be expected." Another person waves at him and beckons. This time,
it's a woman, she has green stripes in the same pattern as Jake.

She shows him to his bed and gives him a locker key. Jake decides he's had enough, he stores away
his stuff and goes to sleep.

In the morning, it was much more peaceful. He went outside of the tent, then regretted the decision
because it was quite cold for his half-naked body, went back inside, put some clothes on and went outside.

Just as it was promised, there was a heliport ready, next to the camp. He was surprised that it was possible
to make one so early.

He picked up his stuff, opened the map and tried to position himself. In a moment, he was able to
figure out the nearest train station, so he picked up his things and left the camp.

This part of the city was not exactly falling apart, but still, in a not so good shape.
He could clearly tell that this district was worse off.

"Good, I have the gun," he thought. It was a CZ-75, a reliable semi-automatic handgun. It was
a bit outdated, with most of them being produced during the Great War, but it still worked well
for most situations.

Jake had to walk for quite a while in this district and although he saw some strange looking fellows,
nothing happened.

Eventually, he reached the train station. Luckily, the card worked.

After a few minutes, the train arrived. Jake was standing near one of the train doors and was waiting
for it to open. When it did, a short girl sprung out from the train and bumped into Jake hard.
Jake saw that she had something like a burn across her right eye. She looked quite irritated and
was cussing under her breath. He could only make out the words "Fucking forgot".

Strange. Jake boarded the train. He was able to find a seat by the window. So he just sat back and
looked at the city.

The city was split by a river. It had an odd color, like a hint of red, Jake thought that they must be
leaking some garbage into it, and that's why it has that color.

The eastern part was in a noticeably better shape than the western part. Both halves of the city
displayed signs of renovation. In the West, it was often shoddy at best. East was more serious about
rebuilding, some reconstructions were still taking place.

He left the train near the South-East Gate. That was the one where the distribution center was.

After about ten minutes of walking, he reached it. There it was, a majestic Sikorsky, with a fresh
black finish. There was another Morpho worker sitting on the skids. He was eating a sandwich. Must be
the other pilot.

Jake greeted the other man and the two confirmed that they are the pilots. The other pilot then
went into one of the buildings. A few seconds later, he emerged with several other people, who
started attaching the large pallet of goods to the helicopter.

There were all sorts of items on the pallet. Bags, crates, boxes, some machines. A coffee machine,
even. One of the boxes had "GUNZ" written on it in crayon. That was a little suspicious even to Jake.
On the other hand, it was probably meant to be a joke.

Soon, the helicopter was ready for lift off.

Start the engine. One hand on the cyclic, one on the collective. Feet on tail rotor pedals. Lift off slowly.

There is a strong south-west wind. Have to account for that. Adjust balance. Rise up.

Maximum altitude available at this load is a bit under 1.5 km. Given the warning, Jake would prefer to go higher,
but it's not possible.

"Flight control, this is Morpho-Sikorsky. We are about to take off. Over."

"Roger, Sikorsky. We only have one helicopter, you don't have to introduce yourself. Over."

"Flight control, there is a strong south-west wind, landing may be difficult, please clear the landing zone of any obstacles
before we get there. Over."

"Roger, Sikorsky. We're on it. Over."

.

.

.

"Flight control, we are about to cross the river. Halfway there. Over."

"Roger, we will be ready for you. Over."

Elsewhere, a moment earlier. A man with binoculars is standing on one of the rooftops. He is in green combat gear,
with a black gas mask and a red cape made of thick plastic. Like a raincoat. He has messy blue hair, the dye
is fading in some places, the length of the hair varies from almost none to a few centimeters. There is
no sense or direction to his hairstyle.

He has several grenades attached to his vest, and above them, a sawed off shotgun and a few shells strapped to its barrel.
On his left side, he has a blood bag attached. A hunting knife is dangling from his belt.

> The greatest hazard of all, losing one’s self, can occur very quietly
in the world, as if it were nothing at all. No other loss can occur
so quietly; any other loss - an arm, a leg, five dollars,
a wife, etc. - is sure to be noticed.

Then, the man spoke.

"Ahhh, what a fine fucking day to be alive. Everything goes well, the sun is shining, the wind is blowing,
and I was just about to go do some 'philanthropy', when I see that life has yet another treat for me."

The man coughs, stretches his hands outward and turns around.

"Rejoice brothers, for tonight... we feast."

He turns around again and points at the helicopter

"That"

.

.

"That cannot be carrying anything good. Black helicopters flying over the city..."

"You know, I used to fly one of these, back in the day. And I can tell you, each time we flown one like that
... we were up to no good."

"But one man's war crimes is another man's come-up. I... want what it's carrying. Weapons, explosives, drugs.
Whatever it is, we need that..."

He turns on his heel again, and runs his hands through his hair.

"Now, this is pretty high, a small target... if you are ordinary. But some of us in the city used
to a kind of special juice... one that... affects you."

"And now you got it all. Better senses, a healing factor, some other stuff... Anything you could ever want..."

He turns on his heels again, picking up a rocket launcher.

"We are the next step in human evolution. It's *homo ascendens*, the climbing man. Rising through the ranks.
We are the missing evolution link... and it's onto us to return it to its proper order..."

"Where weak step aside for the strong, where those who adapt thrive and those who don't are... eliminated.
Seize the day, *Carpe Diem*... soon, we shall return the steering wheel of society to kick-start the natural
selection and save evolution. And I promise you..."

The man turned his head to the ground and spoke more quietly.

"And I promise you... that I will return man the primordial freedom he deserves, liberate him from
the chains, and the strings... and the chains... and the strings... Or else my name isn't Voss!"

"Men! Today is the day we begin! Our long work is finally coming to fruition," he said, patting the blood bag
on his side.

And as he said that, he pointed the rocket launcher at the helicopter and fired.

Meanwhile, in the helicopter.

"Flight control, alert, we got incoming," Jake yelled as he tried to steer the helicopter from the path
of the missile.

"We avoided the missile, but the cargo took a hit. We're bleeding goods."

"Roger Sikorsky, try to get back here as soon as you can. We will have to cut our losses. Over. Hurry up,
we are all on edge. Over."

Back on the ground.

"Ah, we missed... Loot is falling from the sky and the wind is spreading it all over the city...
No matter, it appears what you can't do in one hit, you gotta do in two. Hand me the heat-seeking one."

Eject shell, reload rocket launcher. Prime the weapon, fire.

"Mayday, mayday!!! We got -hit, - lost the hind rotor! Mayday, mayday!! -can't control the -copter."

"Abandon ship, Sikorsky, get out of there."

Jake and the co-pilot jumped out of the helicopter and deployed their parachutes. The helicopter continued
to plummet down and ended up crashing into the river near one of the bridges.

The two pilots were slowly gliding towards the camp.

From up here, the city looks so peaceful. It's... surreal. There is something solemn about it,
and noble. A man's ideal washed away by the years can still shine through if you look closely.
An ambition which turned into something entirely different.

The peace only lasts for a few seconds as gunshots start to fly by the two parachutists.

They try swerving from side to side to avoid the bullets. Co-pilot's parachute gets hit several times,
Jake's only twice. Co-pilot starts to descent faster than Jake.

He ends up somewhere in the western district, while Jake makes it to the camp.

He collapses to the ground, sweaty and breathing heavily. He loses consciousness.

Back on the rooftops.

"Now, gentlemen, I'd only call this a partial success, but a success nevertheless. Now, some of you
go sweep the surrounding streets, there is some cargo, we need everything we can get..."

"The rest of you... refill your blood bags and prepare the sleeping gas grenades and flash-bangs. We are going to
hunt us a... white dove."

Elsewhere, last night.

The music is extremely loud. It has a fast-paced rhythm and is in style reminiscent of the 80s.

The neon lights are flashing brightly, it's enough to give a seizure to many.

A man is stumbling around the club, his entire world is spinning, he is seeing double,
and he keeps seeing afterimages. He feels sick and he can't keep his balance.

He has no idea where is he, or how he got there. He tries to think what the hell did he do,
but his mind only keeps producing a random string of words instead of cohesive thought.

"Maybe rubbing my eyes will help," says a tiny voice somewhere inside his head. It doesn't
improve a situation one bit. The man used too much force and now his vision is even blurrier.

Alright, it is time to get out of here. Where is the exit again? Or was it the entry?
What's the difference? These thoughts and other similar ones keep popping up in the man's head.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>STARRING</b></div>

He looks somewhere in his early twenties, not very muscular, more on the skinny end of the
distribution, even, his black hair seemingly has a mind of its own and forms two large cones,
one on each side of his head. He looks sickly, his pupils are heavily dilated, he looks pale
and glistens with sweat.

There is not a single organized memory in his mind. He keeps seeing flashing images, but
he can't piece it together, no matter how hard he tries.

He nearly forgot: it is time to get out of here. But how? Oh, there is an open window,
maybe he can climb out of it, or so he thinks.

Approach window, grab with arms, jump out, freedom. Sounds easy enough, but there is
a discrepancy between mind and body, it is not easy to coordinate this escape plan.

A moment later, we are set to go, now to just leap out of the window.

3... 2... 1... Jump! Oh no, there has been a miscalculation. The man didn't notice that
this isn't the ground level but the second floor. This one is going to hurt.

Adrenaline rushes through the entire body as he braces for impact.

Ouch! Luckily, he fell into some garbage and is relatively unscathed. The hind side is going
to be painful in the morning, though.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>NEIRO</b> AS THE WINGED ONE</div>

As the man lies in the garbage a butterfly catches his attention. What's this butterfly doing
here? And at night? He must have startled it when he fell.

It is a nice, big blue one. The wings have a black outline. When its wings are closed, it looks
like an eye is staring at you. That is, of course, on purpose, it is what butterflies do to deter
predators.

He tries to reach it, but it flies away.

It is time to get up. First, roll over. Slide down from the garbage. Engage 4x4 movement mode.
Crawl to a wall. Use wall to get back on feet.

The world is spinning even more now. He feels cold. There is no clear goal of his current adventure,
he has no idea where he came from or where he needs to go, but still, he tries to push forward.

Slowly stumbling through the streets. Walls of buildings offer support when necessary.

The entire world is blurry. He tries to look up into the sky, but he is overcome by a sudden spell of
vertigo and has to grab a wall again. Alright good, we are stable again. He feels very hot. So hot,
in fact, that he throws away his sweatshirt. It is winter.
<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>LOKI</b> AS THE AMNESIAC</div>
He stops to breath and finally manages to look up.

The stars are shining bright as winter stars are wont to do and shimmer silently.
In his current state, they are far and yet look very close. He tries to reach them, but he can't.
In his eyes, the stars move and shift, from side to side, some appear to brighten up, other dim down.
Constellations are twisting and turning. The sky comes to life.

If he weren't so out of it, maybe he would've stopped to consider, if this is not the constellations
playing out their stories. A recording of history made by ancient men, forever encoded in the stars
by the shapes we attribute to them.

He briefly shudders and then once again stumbles forward again while still looking at the stars.
He feels cold again.

After a few moments, the adventurer feels a blunt pain. He walked into a pole with a fair bit of force.
A few droplets of blood start flowing from the side of his head.

He grabs on the floor and feels a sudden spell go over him. Oh, no, this one isn't going to be fine.

The adventurer starts vomiting over the pavement. He feels extremely sick, must have hit his
head fairly hard.

He can no longer stand up on his feet, the wall is too far and the pole does not seem like a help
to him. Besides, he christened the pole too, and, despite his condition, didn't want to touch it.
<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>FIRA</b> AS THE CODE</div>
He feels hot again. Feeling a bit of panic and fear over his state, he tries to look around for
something that might help. Ah, a bench!

Crawling along the ground is much harder this time. Left arm. Right leg. Right arm. Left leg. Right leg...?
Right arm...? Right left? Crawling is suddenly a very confusing activity for our man in peril.

Fortunately, within a few minutes, he manages to reach the bench. It takes several attempts to
lift himself up enough to be able to crash into the bench.

The adventurer tries to think what to do next, but Fate, the cruel mistress that she is, has a different plan
for him.

The entire world, still spinning and swinging from side to side becomes blurrier and blurrier... And darker... And darker...

.

.

.

.

The man has a strange dream. One of chaotic images flashing fast, here and there.
<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>HORUS</b> AS THE MAKESHIFT NURSE</div>
Every time he tries to focus on a single one it seems to disappear, and he can feel
his head hurting, despite this being just a dream.

.

Suddenly, he finds himself back in The City. It is morning, the skies are gray and it is raining.
But the rain isn't as most rains are. There is some dark matter in the droplets which leaves stains
on whatever the droplet lands on.

Is it tar? Is it paint? Is it dirt? No, doesn't seem like it. There is something strange about the way
the impurities diffuse in the water.

He finally figures it out. It is ink. And suddenly he can see around himself that the droplets
aren't everything falling from the skies. So are dozens of dead octopuses, squids, crabs and jellyfish.
The ink probably seeped from their dead bodies. The crabs clack and crack when they hit the ground,
the rest loudly splats.

A vague shadow of something indescribably monumental and awe-striking appears through the clouds.
It must be as big as the city and - oh horror! - it moves!

A giant octopus the size of a city block falls from the sky suddenly. It lands in the area where
the adventurer is standing, and streets flood with a mix of blue octopus blood and ink.

The first wave is only up to the adventurer's knees, but the level continues to rise quickly.

Seconds later, it is up to his neck and a few seconds after that, he sinks.

.

He is under the sea right now, sinking down to the sea bed. The water washes away the blood
and the ink.
<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>MINERVA</b> AS THE EX</div>
He tries to float up, but he can't, the surface seems to be infinitely far. He can't see the sea bottom
either.

The man struggles hard, but he runs out of breath quickly. The world starts to become dark again,
before his instincts finally give in, and he breathes in the water.

However, the water seems breathable, very strange. He breathes in and out a few times to confirm.

He tries screaming. A moment later, his echo comes back perhaps even louder.

"Is someone here?" the man yells into the sea.

"Someone here?" responds the echo.

"Is there anyone here but me?" he tries again.

"Me?" comes back.

"I'm searching for a way out, help!"

"I'm searching."
<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>MAGNUSI</b> AS THE VISITOR</div>

There is no point in this, he thinks. It's just a strange echo.

The adventurer floats for a moment and tries to look around if he sees something other than water.

"I CAN'T FIND IT" loudly comes from all sides, in the same way the echo did.

"I CAN'T FIND IT".

"I CAN'T." It is an echo, but it sounds full of wrath, unlike the way the man spoke seconds ago

The sea starts shaking violently, as if there was an earthquake propagating through it. Suddenly a vortex opens
not far from the man and spins faster than any vortex that can be seen on Earth.

He tries to swim away, but the force pulling him in is just too strong. He is sucked in and thrown into the center of
the vortex, where there is no water and just air.

He starts falling and gaining speed very quickly, when suddenly, the dream ends.

.

Back in real life, the man, still unconscious or sleeping, vomits again. Luckily, his head was dangling down from the
bench, so there is no risk of choking.

Elsewhere, a dozen hours earlier.

Minerva was a peddler of sorts. She dealt in some drugs, information and other contraband.
She has been doing this for a very long time, and she was very good at what she was doing.

Although it wasn't her dream vocation, she had talents which were inclined towards sciences in a way
that helped her job.

In the eyes of most men, and women, she was a fox. A feisty seductress, if there ever was one.

She had long red hair and a golden tooth, a taste for fine clothing, and an air about herself
which was disarming to many.

However, this "many" didn't include Endell. He was her ex-boyfriend from what seemed like a long time ago.
For him, she was mostly a headache, although the two managed to reconcile with time.

Speaking of headaches, Minerva was suffering one right at this moment. She had a new girlfriend for
some time, a young-looking girl with a, let's say, "ratty disposition". She was just as eccentric as Minerva,
but in a completely different way. Despite this, and their disparity in temperaments - Minerva was far more mature -
it seemed to click.
<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>HENRY CROSS</b> AS HENRY CROSS</div>
However, it has been a few days since Minerva last saw her. She disappeared seemingly without a trace and this
was worrying. She was afraid that something happened to her girlfriend. After all, this was a dangerous city.

Minerva tried many of her contacts and called several of her friends, but no one knew where she went or
how she disappeared. One account vaguely remembered seeing someone looking like her girl being followed
by a strange man. This was all the more worrying.

Now, she felt helpless. There was nothing she could do except try as hard as she could to learn something
about where her girlfriend could be.

Worrying thoughts were all that was on her mind the entire evening. That is, until someone knocked at the door.

Minerva, being well-versed in the ways of less honorable men, took her weapon of choice with before going
to check the door.

She laid it on a counter next to her door and looked through the peephole. Outside stood a man in a suit.

The suit wasn't in a particularly good shape and probably hasn't been worked or cleaned in a long time. Minerva
immediately noticed that.

To Minerva, the man looked a little fidgety and perhaps a bit shy,
but it seemed he was trying his best to appear normal and friendly.
She was feeling a bit defensive due to the current circumstances.

He was definitely a bit over thirty, he had hair of uneven length, but combed back to seem as presentable
as possible. He had brown contacts, so it was hard to tell what his original eye color was.
In one of his hands was a linen bag. It was possible to make out the outline of two items, a bottle and a box.

"What do you want?" Minerva yelled through the door.

"Hiya, don't worry, I come in peace and unarmed," he said, putting his hands in the air, then turning on his heel
and back.

"I'm... Cross, old friend of Endell's. I'm looking for him, and I was hoping you'd know where he lives, haha!"
continued, scratching his head and stepping from side to side.

He was very animated.

"I've never heard of you." said Minerva coldly.

"Oh no, that old rascal never mentioned me. What about... Henry? That's my first name, maybe he mentioned me
by that name."

"Never heard about a Henry either."

"That's a shame, doing his old friend in like that. But well, Endell was always a bit cold wasn't he.
I mean, look at his eyes and skin. A total ice man!". He turned on his heel.

"But I'm really one of his friends, rest assured.". He turned on his heel back to face the door and stretched his
arms out.

"Sheesh, you are annoying, alright. Take off your coat, throw it to the side and put your hands up."

"Alright, just don't shoot, haha!". He did as she instructed.

Minerva unlocked the door and patted him down. He really wasn't armed. Now, there was a gun in his crotch alright,
Minerva felt that, but not the kind that kills people... more like the opposite.

Minerva pointed her weapon at him and put on a very stern look: "Alright, spill it out. If you are his friend from old days,
then you must know that Endell was in some shady stuff when he was younger. That means you were probably, too. Spill the beans."

The man stepped two steps back and put on a shocked face: "Fine, I concede, I'm a Modified, too, and I met him in the underground,
but I was never really involved with the underground and kinda split off, just like he did. He was good to me all those years
back and now that I've finally managed to pull myself together, I'd like to surprise him and speak to him again."

He tried to turn on his heel, but Minerva interrupted him: "DON'T... MOVE". The man froze in his tracks.

"Hey, look, miss Cerees... I bring gifts." he reached into his bag and pulled out a bottle of wine.

"This is for you, as a sign of good will. Here, it's the Silver '30, a really fine year, hard to come by!"

Minerva saw that this is a really good bottle. "Thanks, what's the other thing in your bag?" - she still wasn't convinced.

"It's my gift for Endell, look. It's a commemorative M9A1 handgun. It used to be standard issue for the military,
this one is a special edition with engravings, very rare. Don't worry, it's unloaded and all, and more of a collector's
piece than anything else. I thought he would appreciate it."

"How did you get your hands on it here in The City?"

"Oh, I had it imported. The bottle too."

Minerva let her guard down a bit finally. The man still looked strange to her, but not dangerous-strange.

"Fine, I will tell you where he lives, but if something happens to him or his girlfriend, I will murder you."

The man attempted to make a friendly pleading gesture as if to lighten the atmosphere.
Minerva shared where Endell lives.

"Thank you, so much. I'm sorry I'm probably annoying you, but I really appreciate this."

"Hmm. I'm sorry I was too aggressive. You see, my girlfriend has gone missing and I'm really
upset about it"

"Oh my, I'm terribly sorry. If there is anything I can do, just let me know. Here is my calling card.
I am not good for much, but anything to help Endell's friends," he said with a slight smile. One of the corners
of his mouth twitched as he said it.

Minerva took the card and then went inside mouthing "goodbye" at the stranger.

The man went back on the street, turned on his heel, stretched his entire body and then ran his hands through
his hair, destroying any semblance of a hairstyle. Hints of greenish blue could be spotted in his hair.

"White dove... located" he thought to himself, letting off a sly smile and cracking his back.
"Today will be... a good day."

He stretched his arms out, looked up into the sky and took a deep breath. He then pulled out his contacts
to reveal clear blue eyes.

# INTERLUDE: MEMORY DATASTORE 15B9B298SY79298N0NS76 > ZmlyYSBhbmQgbWFn

Elsewhere, about a hundred years ago.

Fira Angelica was a pirate.

Her quest for immortality has been changed forever by the realization of
her true nature.

A series of unfortunate events led to an adventure never before seen in this
world.

Right now, she, her brother Azwater and the rest of the crew were escaping their pursuers,
with only two days between their ship and the ships of those, who were after them.

Azwater, Fira, and the crew were running low on supplies and, Geoffrey Brimes
was injured, they urgently needed to make a stop.

It took them three days of sailing to reach Dead Whale Port, the closest pirate
sanctuary. Now, the rules of the port were similar to many other pirate-ran locations.
Regardless of your relationships with other pirates, no combat was allowed within
its waters. There was the rest of the Pirate Code too, but that's too long to explain.

It was evening when their ship landed in the port. They had to restock as quickly
as possible and Geoffrey needed his wound tended to, so the entire crew sprung out of
the ship like a well-fired cannonball. Well, apart from Geoffrey, he needed Benji
to help him get to the healer.

Dead Whale Port was home to the finest pubs in the area and most members of the
crew knew that. Since it turned out that not all of them were needed to restock the ship,
Shizo Ran invited Fira for a drink.

They went into the closest pub to their ship. It was an open building, so they had
a beautiful view of the sea. Older, more experienced pirates seemed to like this pub
because of this since, for a true sea rover, the ocean was the only true love.

Shizo ran signaled over to the waitress: "A beer for me and the lady!"

"Ah, thank you," Fira responded, blushing slightly.

A short while later, they both had a pint in front of them.

"Cheers," they both said, touching their jugs of beer.

...

"You know, if we succeed in this quest, I'd like to come here again. I like this place,"
said Fira suddenly with dreamy eyes.

"Yeah, I like it here too," responded Shizo with a smile.

Shizo diverted his attention to Fira's jug: "Hey, don't overdo it, you kiddo! If you
drink this fast, you will end up under the table! You know you are a lightweight, even for beer,"
he said with a smirk.

"No, I'm not, eeek," Fira retorted, slightly embarrassed after their previous experiences,
"and I'm not a kiddo".

"Oh, I'm sorry, it's just when you are this short, I mistook you for a toddler". Shizo was
having a very good time at the moment.

Fira let out a growl. She had soon almost finished the beer. She and Shizo chit-chatted about
their journey and discussed the plans their crew had, but suddenly, they were interrupted
by Benji, who joined them at the table.

"Hey, what are you two doing here? Are you babysitting, Shizo?" Benji started.

"Not yet, but hey, lay off her, I already bullied her about that a few minutes ago."

"Well, sure, I guess. I'm here just to have a quick pint anyway. I need to pick up old Brimes
in a bit. He will be good, apparently, the wound wasn't hard to heal, but he won't be able to
walk for a few more days."

"Oh, that's good to hear," Fira responded, "I mean... the fact that he will be okay is great, not that
he will need a few days to recover," she corrected herself.

"Yea, it's great, but the geezer is more insufferable than ever, haha. I think we are going
to hear all about it for the next month or so."

Shizo laughed: "A month? That's optimistic. I mean, I like to tell stories, but I'm no match for a cranky
vindictive Brimes. Until the end of our journey, I say! Not a minute earlier."

Fira was enjoying the small-talk with her friends, but she noticed something that put her on her edge.
Someone was watching her.

A man donning a black dress with a black coat over it, and a black hat with a large white feather. Most of his
face was obscured by the hat, but she could tell that he was watching her from the other end of the pub.
She only briefly saw a flash of his eyes, and they looked... red? She thought she must be mistaken.

Anyways, it was probably just her imagination playing tricks on her. Her recent life has been a
roller coaster, it was most likely making her be not herself her a bit. Or so she thought.
A more pressing question was on her mind, now that she learned who she really was. "What am I
actually like?"

She was absorbed in her thought for a bit, but she was disturbed by Benji and Shizo reacting to someone
coming over to them.

It was the strange man in black. He really had red eyes with a triangular pupil. Fira noticed one of his
eyes spinning a tiny bit.

"I'm sorry, gentlemen and gentleladies," looking at Fira, "to interrupt you this fine evening. I come in peace
a fellow lover of the sea to fellow lovers of the sea and I would like to ask you, gentlemen, if I could borrow the
lady for a minute? Don't worry, I just want to speak to her for a minute."

"No, thank you," responded Fira. She didn't know this man and frankly, she was a little scared about his visage.

"I'm sorry, matey, not today, go bother someone else. We are in a hurry" responded Shizo and Benji.

"Oh, I see, then," responded the man.

He leaned over to Fira and whispered something in her ear. Fira froze and became white as a wall.
Very pale.

She said: "Excuse me for a moment, boys, I will be right back." and went to an open walk-in tent
with the man.

The man began: "As I said, you are artificial."

"How do you know that?"

"I am not really a human. Call me mag or magnusi, by the way, nice to meet you. My eyes are special, and they can see
that your inner structure is very symmetrical and perfectly laid out. Your bones, some organs, and so on. It appears as
if it was by design. Furthermore, there is a hole in your neck, which only got covered by your skin,
but doesn't seem to make any attempt to fill itself with any tissue. As if it was a slot for something."

"Alright, you are right, I'm artificial, I was made by someone. I'm just some complex code, it seems. What do you want from me?"

"Nothing, I was just being curious. I too am a part biologically artificial, but in my case, I did it myself.
Now then, I'm interested in who made you."

"He is called Echo, and he is a god."

"A 'god' you say? Oh...," continued mag with a sly smile, "well I know about a few of them. Some people count me
in that category, too. You see, I got some strange powers and a very large number of years under my belt, haha. Tell me more."

Fira then continued explaining her condition, about who she is, who Echo is, and how he treats her, who Ciara is
and how Fira's whole ordeal works, and why she is on her quest for immortality.
Without really knowing why, she tried as best as she could to piece together the information she had available in this world.

"Interesting, I have never heard about anything like this. It seems that me and my boys operate slightly differently
than this Echo god. Curious."

mag continued: "Well, I cannot bestow immortality upon you or your brother, unfortunately, but I can give you
a little something to maybe help you on your way."

magnusi pulled out a vial and slit his wrist, using his abilities to softly and silently guide the blood into the vial.

Then he pulled out a cork and sealed it.

"Look, this is my blood. It will help heal any wound better than most medicines there are. But beware, you have to be subtle.
My blood is toxic in a way, in that it spreads my essence into others as a sort of poison, so don't use too much of it on one
person, or else they might suffer some unwelcome side effects including developing insanity and some of my powers for a short while."

"Thank you, very much. It's a great help," Fira responded, but she was a little worried about the warnings magnusi gave her.

"There is one more thing. Come closer."
Fira did.

magnusi took her head and put it against his so that the two of them were touching on their foreheads.

"Now, look into my eyes." magnusi's eyes were spinning and jerking a little, like if you try to focus a camera, until
they reached a synchronized position with one of the triangles' points pointing up.

"Recall everything you can about this god of yours and whatever else you consider important."
Fira didn't know what she would consider important on such short notice, so her thoughts were really all
over the place.

"Alright," continued magnusi.

Then his eyes spun left rapidly for a fraction of a second, Fira suddenly felt a spell of nausea and walked a few steps
away from mag while holding her eyes and her head.

"What the hell was that?" she asked.

"I took some information. That is my price."

He then pulled out his golden parachronal stopwatch.

"Unfortunately, I was hoping I would be able to talk to you for a while longer, but it appears that time is not on
my side right now. And neither on yours, as you said. You better hurry back to your ship. I'm hoping that we will meet again in the
future."

"Thank you for your help. Good-bye," responded Fira, walking away, now slightly more optimistic and waving. She thought that
if it came to worst, and they didn't have the immortality for Azwater and herself, then maybe she could at least heal her brother.

magnusi, however, had to leave the world and would end up barred from ever returning to it.

Fira choose to keep the vial a secret for now, maybe forever, given the warnings, and she lied to the rest of the crew
about the meeting, saying that he was trying to convince her to join her crew by saying he knows about immortality,
but that in reality, he didn't seem to know anything they hadn't already learned during their adventure.


# EPISODE 1: LOKI
> If there are things that upset you, chaotic, terrible, serpentine monstrous
underworld things that threaten you, the best thing to do is to open your eyes,
get your speech organized, and go out and confront the thing, and make the world
out of it.

Endell sat up in his bed. He was an albino with blond hair, a fairly muscular build,
blue eyes, and a characteristic mole on his face. His hair, which was slightly longer than was
common, but not long enough to warrant a ponytail or anything of that sort, was usually swept back.
Not now, since he was still rolling around in bed.

He had a lazy day today. All he planned to do was some cleaning,
reading and maybe doing some repairs.

This wasn't exactly morning and Endell, as a Modified, didn't need to sleep as much as regular
humans, but everybody needs to be lazy sometimes.

His girlfriend, Neiro, has left their home hours ago, she had some errands to run and wanted
to visit Valentine. Since she and Endell got together, they realized that neither of them is a
good enough cook in the long term. So Neiro, inspired by her friend, tried to better herself
in that department.

That was the reason for her visit - to let Val taste her latest attempt at cooking. Now, cooking
requires attention and skill, both of which were hit-and-miss at times, in Neiro's case. This
meant that some of her earlier attempts bordered on food poisoning or chemical contamination,
nevertheless, there was a smooth upwards trend in the quality of her cooking.

The first designated taster was always Endell since he could eat anything without suffering
major repercussions. If he didn't immediately reject the food, then it was good for a critique
by Valentine. Now, Valentine was as sweet a guy as there can be, but there were some skills
he took pride in.

However, right now, Endell didn't have anything to eat. Not anything warm, anyways. He wasn't
particularly hungry, but he also really wanted to eat something.

Fried eggs it is. So, time to get out of bed and do some cooking. He only briefly folded the
sheets, thinking he can do it later no problem. He didn't put on a T-shirt either, that comes
later. Besides, grease can sometimes fly out of the pan, and he didn't want to have a dirty
shirt.

And so he got up, readied the pan, turned on the stove, took out the butter, and cracked some eggs.
He preemptively put a plate on the table and took out a knife and a fork. There was also a book on the table.
It was about Roman law, which is one of the first legal topics law students examined during
their studies.

Now, before the eggs are ready, he thought he could listen to some music. He was just mostly looking
to fill the time until he could eat. He went over to the music player, which was on a counter in
the kitchen and pressed play, expecting his usual tunes.

That didn't happen, instead what came out was something else and Endell quickly turned it off.
"Hell", he thought, "she swapped out the cassettes again without telling me."

Now, after being with Neiro for some time, he learned how to live with Neiro music, but
what she had in the cassette player didn't fit the occasion, suffice to say.

However, there were also things happening outside his home.

A blue butterfly, with wings that had a black edge, was fluttering around in clear view of
Endell and Neiro's place of stay. It was a church, not very used, but since two years ago, it
looked at least a bit better. The inside was decorated with things that didn't traditionally
belong in a church, but I will leave you, dear listener, to figure out the person responsible-
Let me just hit that you should reach a - short - conclusion.

A hand in a glove suddenly crushed the butterfly and the killer then wiped it off on his raincoat
looking cape.

Upstairs, Endell could hear some commotion from the outside. But that wasn't out of the ordinary.

However, in a moment, he heard a knock on the door of their flat. So he went to the door and said:

"Hello?" as he was about to go to the peephole to look at who it is.

Just as he spoke, though, there was a shotgun blast, and many pellets made it through the door,
several of which hit Endell in the chest. This wasn't enough to harm Endell, but it
staggered him for a moment.

Action.

A second blast destroyed the door lock and the nob and the door swung right open. Men in combat gear
start flooding through the door as smoke and gas grenades crash in through the windows releasing
their fumes.

Smoke starts filling the flat as Endell rolls back into the kitchen and grabs the first makeshift
weapon he could find, the egg pan.

He throws the eggs at one of the assailants and slams another over the head with it. All of them
were geared up, but he managed to hit the first one in exposed skin on the neck, so he screamed and stumbled.

Bang, Endell hit him too.

Bang, Bang, Bang, another attacker.

Some of them manage to take out their handguns and knifes and start to fire into the smoke.

Endell is starting to feel a little dizzy due to the sleep gas. As he is modified, it won't
be enough to knock him out on its own, but it slowed him down ever so slightly.

Bang, bang, Endell gets hit two times in the chest by a handgun.

He grabs a man close to him and slams him into the wall, as he bounces back, he bashes
him over the head with the pan as a baseball bat.

Sounds of metal. A knife. Endell manages to stop the hand with the knife and twist it back,
releasing it.

He catches it, in mid-air, turns it around and embeds it in the attackers neck.

Endell gets shot again in the back. He grabs another assailant and throws him into the bathroom, closing the
door behind him.

He then shoves a few attackers to the side and rolls into the bedroom, throwing the pan into the face
of one of them.

He grabs one of his Skorpions, switches the fire-mode selector from safety to full-auto and empties
a magazine into two men who are just entering through the bedroom door.

Another grenade flies in, this time it's a flash bang. Endell was too slow to notice. The gas and
healing of his wounds are starting to take a toll on him.

A man in a red raincoat-material hood comes in. It's Voss. He takes out an engraved M9A1, kicks
Endell into the chest and then fires several times.

Endell is a little dazed, but he recovers and kicks Voss out. Voss stumbles back and Endell catches him
off-guard by plunging a knife that fell out of one of the attackers between neck and collarbone.

Another man rolls in and goes after Endell, pinning him down for a few seconds. He tries to choke Endell,
but Endell manages to punch him into his gas mask, shattering his left eye glass and thus sending several glass
shards into the man's eye.

The man screams, grabs his eye and opens himself to another left and right hook from Endell, which
puts him out of the play.

The choking attempt made Endell's vision a bit blurry, and his hearing was impacted as well.

Suddenly, Voss appears from Endell's side and punches him hard in the stomach and as
Endell bends over because of the impact but Voss punches him back into the temple.

A faint blue glow can be seen through Voss's gas mask eye glasses and Endell suddenly
finds it much harder to move, but he can push through.

Voss kicks him into a half-open closet, shattering one of the wooden doors, but the closet otherwise
softens Endell's impact.

Endell isn't feeling very good.

He didn't notice that Voss is holding a primed grenade in his hand and can barely react as he throws it
at him, while turning on his heel and picking up a ceramic bowl, which Neiro left on the nightstand
after snacking last night.

It's a flash bang, Endell is blinded by the light and deafened by it going off. He is staggered.

Voss doesn't slow down and slams Endell over the head with the bowl, which shatters it and leaves
several cuts on Endell's face.

Endell is almost done. He tries to blindly swing it at Voss, but he misses.

Voss knocks him to the ground and then sits on his chest as other attackers are filling the room.

He hits Endell in the face.

Left hook.

Right hook.

Left hook.

Right hook.

Left.

Right.

Left.

Right.

He grabs Endell by the arms, lifts him into sitting position and headbutts him with full force, producing
a crack in one of the eye glasses and a bloody stain on Endell's forehead.

With the added effects of the sleep gas, Endell's world fades to black, and he loses consciousness.

friend; love that has grown cold can kindle.

Neiro was done with the cigar. She handed it back Horus, and he pulled in a few times as well,
then he tapped it to knock out the ashes and smothered it with his glove. You shouldn't put out
a cigar like that, but he didn't have anything to cut it with.

"So, where do we go next, Neiro?" Horus asked, "You said you had more errands to run, right?"

Neiro thought for a few seconds, then responded: "Actually, I need to go to me and my boyfriends'
place. I need to send a letter, but I forgot it at home."

She was a little cranky about it, but it was nothing out of the ordinary.

"We need to go to the train station and ride the train for a few stops."

There was a train stop close to Valentine's home, but Horus and Neiro walked off while smoking a cigar
too far, in the direction that was closer to the truck despite neither of them having any planned direction.

Earlier today, Neiro left the train at the station next to Val's, so she could take a walk.

Horus and Neiro then walked over to the train station. On their way, Horus could see more of how the city
looks like. There was a lot of establishments one might consider unsavory, and, despite this being the wealthier
part of the city, its look didn't necessarily inspire security.

Suddenly, Horus stop and asked: "You see that guy over there on the bench? He looks to be in a pretty bad
shape. You think he's alright?"

Neiro responded: "Probably." It was not uncommon to see drug addicts in the city. Since the pill market
was still a little shaken, with recipes of Modified medication being only in the hands of few, it was most likely
he was a Modified who didn't get his pills in time or even lacked the money to get them.

After all, he only had a T-shirt and sweatpants on him. It was winter.

Neiro was about to start walking forward, but Horus stopped her and said: "Hey, let's check on him, see if he is
alright."

She sighed, but followed him over to the sleeping, unconscious, or possibly dead, man on the bench.

Horus grabbed him by the shoulders and started shaking him. "Hey, you alright? Can you hear me? Wake up, man."

This didn't help. Horus pulled out a small, but bright flashlight. He opened one of the man's eyes and shone into
it. Neiro could feel that he isn't Modified. That surprised her.

The man's pupil reacted to the light, luckily, so he wasn't in that of a dire condition. Both Horus and Neiro
could see that his pupils were already very dilated, he probably had some strong stuff in his system.

Horus tried slapping him to one side of his face and the other. The man finally starts producing sounds.

"Howdy, can you hear me? What's your name? Are you alright?"

The man opens his eyes with difficulty and growls. He tries to speak: "Mhnmh-ehh".

Then he suddenly quickly tilts his head to the side and vomits on the pavement, for at least fifteen seconds.

He then starts breathing in a more healthy manner, maybe a little too fast, but that is to be expected.

"Hey, good? What's your name?" Horus repeats. It's not his first time seeing people in this state.
Neiro, however, was a little shocked by the sudden projectile vomit.

"Loki?" responds the man in a way which does not betray whether that's his name, or if he is calling out
for someone, or perhaps mistaking Horus for another man.

He then closes his eyes again and presumably falls asleep.

Horus reacts to the whole situation: "Alright, it doesn't look like this Loki is in grave danger, but I
don't think it would be fair to leave him out like that. It's cold, and well, he isn't freezing to death,
but his lips are a little blue. I will take him to the truck and let him rest. Would you like to come with?"

He lifted this "Loki" and put him over his shoulder. Horus was a pretty big and appeared to be muscular
(despite his beige trench coat obscuring most of his physique to Neiro and any possible nearby observer),
and Loki was more on the scrawny side and shorter than Horus.

Neiro suddenly remembered: "Oh no... I forgot to give Valentine my..shit, Shit. I need to go to Valentine's again,
sorry."

"Ah, never mind, it's fine. Meet me at the truck, then?"

"Okay."

"Oh, and... wait for a second... Here you go," added Horus, holding a bill. "Consider it a, hmm, initial down payment."
It was more than Neiro expected.

Neiro then went to the nearest station and travelled one station back, so she was very close to Valentine's.

She was very angry at herself because her list of forgotten things today was becoming longer and longer.
The worst thing was that she of course, forgot what all she forgot, so every new discovery was an unwelcome surprise.

She was cussing to herself the entire way, and when she was leaving the train, she didn't pay attention and ran into
someone. He was a pretty normal blond guy wearing blue overalls and a baseball cap. He had a pretty large backpack,
but that's all she noticed.

Neiro was once again at peace when she could let Valentine taste her cooking. He commented that it is definitely
an improvement since last time, but that she maybe went a little too hard with the soy sauce.

Valentine the asked, if the guy can be trusted. Neiro then said that so far, there hasn't been any red flags
and pulled out the bill Horus gave her, exclaiming that she isn't broke right now.

Val found it suspicious that such good money was only the down payment, so he told her to watch herself,
hugged her, and sent her on her way.

Meanwhile, Horus was strutting through the streets with a body over his shoulder.

He said, in a stern tone: "Hey, Loki-person, if you last meal decides to go out with a blast again,
and if it's on my coat, then it will be a different kind of last meal. Hear me?" He said the last question
in a more relaxed tone. But Loki did not seem to be on planet Earth right now.

After a while, he reached his truck, opened the container and climbed in with Loki. There was a compact
couch in the back lining the wall that was behind the driver's cabin. He laid Loki on the couch and then
climbed the leather to the top floor of the container, where he retrieved a bucket, which he put beside Loki,
to ensure easier clean up in case he throws up again.

Now, this was no ordinary bucket. It came from Emilia-Romagna in Italy. This bucket was, according to the
legend, a bone of contention between the rivaling cities of Bologna and Modena. Despite it being a simple
oaken bucket, it became a coveted war trophy. The historians disagree on the veracity of these claims,
nevertheless, the bucket was at one point an important cultural item.

Horus was able to snatch it many years ago from the ruins left of the cities after the Great War.

Despite its value as an oddity, it was still a bucket and could work as such.

Next, he took a water bottle out of the cooler and soaked a towel with it and put it on Loki's forehead.
Loki definitely had a fever, so he hoped this would help.

He then closed the container, noting: "Alright then, this guy isn't waking up for several hours at least,
so he won't mind."

Horus then went to the cabin of the truck and retrieved another cigar, to have ready just in case.
He was not really a smoker, but it has proven today to be a valuable bargaining chip in relation to his
strange guide.

He stretched his arms and massaged his shoulder and then he went to take a walk around the block.

First, he went into the abandoned industrial area and checked out a few warehouses, but after a while, he went back,
more towards the center of the city.

A few minutes later, he found a sketchy convenience store. Horus entered and greeted the cashier,
who was smoking and didn't respond to the greeting. He also had bullet-proof glass above his counter.

He inspects the food section and ends up picking up some chips. He never heard of this flavor before.
The name sounded like a chemical.

Horus walks over to the cash register, hands the bag of chips to the cashier who rings it up
and takes Horus's coins, returning the change.

Horus then leaves, saying goodbye to the cashier, who once again doesn't respond and only
looks at him. It is not certain, why he was like that, perhaps it was just his personality,
maybe the fact that he could tell that Horus was a foreigner also did not help.

Back to the truck now.

When he gets there, Neiro is already standing there, smoking a cigarette.

Horus snatches it, throws it away, and, without saying anything, pulls out the final bit of the cigar. Neiro
doesn't object this time. The cigar really is better than the cigarette.

The two then board another train to go to the church. Neiro and Endell previously considered moving out,
but it turned out that they did not have the resources after their flat was broken into and several items,
plus money, were stolen. Endell was generally careful about protecting his property, but a strange coincidence
gave an opportunity to a petty burglar.

Endell eventually tracked down the thief and delivered some justice, but the thief no longer had their stuff.
This forced Endell to take a job as car mechanic to raise the household income. Eventually, they were able to
at least renovate Endell's original flat and make it a more homely place.

After a while of travel - it was just three stations, the first one, Val's and then over the river,
one that was close to their home, so it didn't take that long - Horus and Neiro leave the train and
walk towards the church.

When they reach it, they can both tell that something is not right. There is a lot of fine dust
settled on the ground around the property, and there are holes in the window panes.

"Do your windows generally have holes in them?" asks Horus.

"No... they don't." A chill runs down Neiro's spine, she has a bad feeling about this.

The two come inside to investigate.

They start walking up the stairs, but Neiro starts breaking into a sprint as soon as she notices
the front door is open.

Horus grabs her by the elbow and pulls her back.

"Watch out," he says more silently, and points to the ground, "look, tripwire. You need to pay attention,
could have killed us both."

He pulls out a revolver. It's a Colt Single Action Army cavalry model, the staple of Old West.

"Alright... you have a revolver?" asks Neiro, but moves forward more carefully. Horus walks in front of her,
so she isn't the immediate target of gunfire, should there be an attacker still inside.

"Yes, it is a very fine piece, although a highly impractical weapon," he says almost whispering.

They enter the flat and Neiro is shocked. Everything is in disarray, there are bullet holes, blood stains,
shards of both glass and ceramics, a bloody frying pan and many shell casings lying everywhere. Doors are destroyed,
and there are discharged grenades near the windows and a few in the bedroom.

One of Endell's Skorpions is lying on the ground, covered with blood.

Neiro falls on her knees and starts hyperventilating, she is in complete shock. Her eyes are wide open
and staring into the ground. Tragic memories flush through her mind. Tears start streaming down her cheeks and her
eyes become red.

Horus kneels one of his knees in front of Neiro to get to her level, grabs her by the shoulders and shakes
with her: "Hey, pull yourself together. Look around, now is not the time for this... Your boyfriend is alive, look,
there is no body, all the grenades are non-lethal. There are signs of struggle, he probably did a number of them.
See that pan?"

Neiro still isn't responding. Horus shakes her again: "Hey!! Listen. I will help you find your boyfriend,
but you need to pull yourself together. Hey!!"

Neiro finally looks up.

"I don't know what to do," she says, still crying.

"Hey, on the train, you said you had a friend who is involved with the criminal underworld. These were no
ordinary attackers, see the artillery? She might know something, alright?"

"Yea, I guess," Neiro responded, slowly regaining her composure, but still heavily shaken by what she witnessed.
Right now, she can't imagine this place ever being back the way it was.

"Can you call her? It might be easier than going to her place."

"Yea..."

Neiro, still sobbing a bit, wiped her nose and pulled out her phone.

She dialed Minerva and waited for her to pick up.

"Hey, Neiro, what's up?" said Minerva cheerfully, slightly inebriated with good wine.

"Hi...," said Neiro, immediately starting to cry again.

"OH MY GOD, what happened?" Minerva dropped her wine glass.

Neiro started to try explaining what was going on and Minerva was
becoming quickly more and more horrified.

At some points, she cried so much she couldn't put together a whole sentence, so would Horus speak into
the phone to fill in what Neiro was unable to say.

Minerva was completely shocked and very disturbed.

Horus was trying to ask, if she doesn't know who could have done it, but Minerva had a hard time
figuring it out.

Then it suddenly hit her. She put two and two together and became horrified and overcome with guilt.
It was that strange man. It was her fault, she led him to her. Her eyes teared up a little,
messing up her eyeliner. It was too much for her, first Rat, now Endell. She felt horrible.

She tried to explain to Neiro, but it was hard. She didn't question who Horus was, given the
circumstances, but she told them to come to her, that they need to figure something out.

She also said that the man left a calling card and that there is an address on it, that it might
be the place where they are keeping Endell.

Since they would need to switch to a different train and the intervals are slow now that it is evening,
Horus proposed they depart the train at the station near which is the truck lot and take the truck to Minerva's place.
This would definitely be to the chagrin of other participants of the traffic, given the truck's proportions.

After a while, they departed the train. Horus could spot a blue butterfly near the station, but he was
quickly distracted by the sounds of gunfire, coming from nearly everywhere.

People were screaming from all around. Perhaps, it was the whole city. The sky started to darken.

Strange soldiers in black gear started flooding the city, coming from near the power plant. There were probably
thousands of them in the city.

Gunfire all around.

Horus decided: "What the hell, this is bad. We need to run, quickly! To the truck!"

They started running through the chaos on the streets. The armored men were only about a hundred meters behind them,
they were firing occasionally at or near people.
A few shots flew right by him and Neiro.

Horus spotted that they are non-lethal shots, rubber balls. Made to make a bruise but not to kill.
Neiro looked behind, she could see the soldiers advancing forward and pushing people back into the houses.

They were taking some people, ones that looked particularly horrible. Horus saw one of these people seemingly
emerge from the ground.

One soldier walked out from an alley that Horus and Neiro were about to run past. Horus quickly pulled out his
revolver, shot him, cocked the hammer again and shot him for a second time.

The soldier seemed to be knocked back and staggered, since the SAA does pack a punch as a weapon, but otherwise
seemed unaffected. Neiro felt something strange about the soldier.

However, these two shots were able to give them a window to escape, they turned a corner and they were
finally close to the parking lot.

They ran quickly over to the truck, but another soldier appeared and opened fire.

Neiro felt strange, and then she finally figured it out. It felt like the soldier was Modified,
she could tell thanks to her abilities.

Meanwhile, Horus emptied the rest of the clip into the masked soldier, but it didn't seem to have any
effect beside staggering him.

Horus was able to unlock the truck, but Neiro tried something. It has been a long time since she used her
abilities. She tried to figure out if she could control the soldiers movement.

She focused and used her power. But what happened was something she didn't not expect.
The soldier's eyes lit up blue through his mask, he dropped his weapon and started slowly walking away,
not paying any attention to either Horus or Neiro.

"Take the gun and pass it," yelled Horus, who already opened left door of the truck.

Neiro snapped out if it and did as he said, throwing the gun over to Horus.

Horus pointed it another soldier that was closing in and staggered him. He noticed the weapon had two magazines,
the other was filled with lethal rounds, so he switched to those.

They were more effective than the rubber ones, but still couldn't stop the soldier.

Neiro tried it again. Once again, the soldier dropped his weapon and walked away.

"This one too?" she asked.

"No, it's too far away! Get in!" yelled Horus. He quickly climbed into the truck and pulled Neiro up.

Start ignition, step on clutch, shift gears. No time to poke astronaut. Time to get out of here.

He floored the gas pedal and started quickly stepping on the clutch and shifting gears to build up speed as
quickly as possible.

"We cannot go to Minerva's, the city is flooded with these strange black things. I think we can hole up in the
industrial zone, they seemed to go after people, and there weren't people there when I went there for a walk,"
Horus quickly said.

"Yea, it's abandoned," said Neiro. Then she realized their predicament and blurted out: "Oh my god...".
She held her head din their hands, then she started cracking her knuckles again and again. She was really on
edge, but this wasn't the time to smoke.

"I saw one large abandoned warehouse there, it looked pretty good, I think we can hide near it, then
figure out what to do next."

"Alright."

Neiro pulled out her phone and tried to call Minerva, but there was no reception. Zero signal. The cell
network must have been hijacked.

As they progressed towards the zone, they could see fewer and fewer soldiers. Horus ran over about five of
them, then they stopped.

They reached the warehouse. There was no one there. Horus pulled over behind the warehouse, near its wall,
so they weren't seen from the city center.

Then he let out a sigh of relief and said: "Well, I haven't had this much action in years."

He then left the truck to go into the container to check on Loki, who was still in there.

Loki was still sleeping.

Horus looked up to the sky. It was somewhat dark. Very little stars could be seen. There was no moon.

.

.

.

Elsewhere, some time earlier.

A man on a horse rides into the Morpho encampment from the side of the walls. Behind him, hundreds, if
not thousands of black soldiers follow on foot. Their march is perfectly in unison, it sounds almost artificial.
Just like a perfectly prepared army parade.

The man on the horse stops on in front of one of the Morpho officers. The man was wearing a black coat,
black pants, a hat, black riding gloves and riding boots.

He was bleeding from his left hand.

The officer greeted him: "Greetings boss, glad you could make it."

"Thank you, Andrew. What's our status, what about the helicopter?"

Andrew the officer explained the situation.

"I see, that is unfortunate. The helicopter was supposed to carry my personal effects, too,
not to mention important machinery. Anyways, we brought a lot of machinery and materials as well.
What's the condition of the pilots, Jake and William?"

"Jake is here, in the infirmary. He was shot in the thigh during his descent and lost a fair bit
of blood, but he should be fine. We haven't found William yet. He appears to have landed earlier,
somewhere in the city, due to a damaged parachute. We sent out a few people to find him already."

"Ah, I'm sorry, I exposed my men to a greater danger than I expected it would be. I appreciate their
work. Hopefully, they will both be fine. I will do my best to make it up to them.
Nevertheless, we need to proceed with the operation."

"Understood, Boss."

The Boss turned on his horse and yelled out: "Venerable Sentinels, your time has come. Rise and seize
the city. Bring in those we need. Put everything on lock-down!"

He then pulled out a flare gun and fired a flare into the sky. This alerted even the Sentinels who were
farther away and had no chance of hearing him.

They started to flood into the city.

# INTERMEZZO: CARTOGRAPHER

Well, that was climactic. And longer than I expected. I am getting really invested into the story,
haha.

These last bits have been quite extensive, and many characters were introduced. It might be
confusing for a listener who doesn't pay attention, but you surely do.

Anyways, I thought that it might be nice to reward you with some information, or call it trivia,
about some of our new acquaintances.

Behold, although partially obscured and intentionally incomplete, my glorious data-sheets:

So this is Neiro. She is one of the characters we meet first.
I am particularly partial to her, I think she has depth as a person
and I like her antics.

Her earlier life wasn't particularly easy, she came to The City after being hit
by a truck, which by coincidence was similar to Horus's - it could not have been his,
since he was still in Europe at the time - and a few years ago
became tangled up in a plot that was so outlandish she couldn't have made it up
if she wanted to! Not even in a dream.

Neiro eventually found out that she is not a regular human, similar to her friend
Valentine, but a type of Modified, one that they call Winged Ones... I think. Sheesh,
hearing this always makes me think of chicken wings, shame I am getting none of those
here in my realm. Could go for a breather though, it's been a few years since I last
left this place.

Being "Winged" gave her several perks and abilities, but ones unlike those of, say, Endell,
a different type of Modified, one that is colloquially just referred to as "Modified". If you
have been privy to her previous history, you know all about it, but here, dear listener,
I would like to preserve the suspense a little longer.

As a person, some describe Neiro as an angry goofball, which is no doubt amplified by her
short stature, but there is depth to her personality, and she is anything but one-directional,
so to speak. Talent lies within her, partially realized, largely dormant.

Horus is another of first introduced characters, just like Neiro. In
that sense, he is just like her a protagonist in the original meaning of the word -
"one who plays the first part". However, it is hard to say who is actually the center-piece
of a large branching story like this.

Horus is a strange man. He was born in a war-torn country and was an orphan since before
he could remember, being adopted by a separatist group. He spent his younger years
as a child soldier, an experience, which, while definitely not easy and leaving permanent
evidence of its existence on him as a human, provided him in later years with levelheadedness,
which is complimented by a form of idealism, uncommon in most people.

That is not to say he is without vices. His approaches to solving some things are peculiar to
say at least, and there is an air of vanity about his collection of trinkets and oddities. It
is irresponsible to drive a truck when one of your eyes does not work well - although he does
an admirable job despite that - and taking a weapon for protection which is attractive,
but impractical in comparison to modern day handguns may not be the wisest choice either.

After years of combat, Horus was finally able to retire from the battlefield and enter a new vocation.
Building a large business selling light bulbs. He was always fond of the light, more of the light produced
by tiny sources such as light bulbs, or the stars. Sun interested him none. However, it is not all
nice and legal - he supplies some criminals with light bulbs too.

We first meet Valentine when Neiro goes to visit him, taking Horus with her during
her shoddy attempt to be a guide to the city. We can see that he is a good-natured
and caring guy and that he is worried about Neiro's safety.

Valentine, is just like Neiro, a second-generation Winged One. He lived for many years
in hiding with his father to avoid being caught by the elusive former ruler of The City.
Val ended up losing his father a few years ago, in an event that had a deep impact on him.

He owns a gay bar in the city, and he himself is attracted to men, but as far as my
information reaches, there is no record of a long term relationship. In his free time,
he creates graffiti, cultivates and smokes weed, and indulges himself in eccentric clothing.

Eccentricity is his own in more aspects than just clothing, as we may later find out,
or, as is evident from previous records of his history.

Valentine is also a good cook, an excellent food critic, and Neiro's confidant, which
is why she chose him as a food taster, or, in other words, as a victim.

Loki is a character that was introduced later. Just in the last episode,
as you surely remember. He is a strange fellow, who undeniably has a problem
with substances.

We do not know at this point if he is actually called Loki, or if he was looking for
a person called Loki.

There were some hard drugs in his system, and he could have died, if he were left out
in the cold for much longer. He does not seem Modified or biologically unusual in any
other way, but he has a strange hairstyle as I described earlier.

At this point in the story, he only showed little personality, we only really hear him
speak in his dream and that also isn't evocative of what he is like, but we can
deduce from the data I presented and from his condition, that he is not typically
the type of person one would get acquainted with or want to keep around, if they
go by the old adage of making friends with people who want good for you, do not
destroy their surroundings, and promote growth.

However, there is still a path to redemption from being a miserable and woefully
blind crackhead, just like there is a path for others who reject reality.

Right now, he is stuck with Horus and Neiro, and, although he may prove to be
a pain the hind parts, they can't just rid of him. Who knows, maybe he will eventually
prove himself useful.

Alright, there you have four data-sheets for four characters. I think it would be
too boring if I were just to spill all of them at once, so I will just trickle them slowly
to you. There is no visual yet, I'm still thinking about it.

Nevertheless, there is one "visual" thing I want to show, for future reference. It will come
in handy. Here is where I really start to shine.

Here, for your inspection, a map of the city of Yiandh (pronounced 'yand', for the linguistically disabled).

![Yiandh](/media/yiandh.png)

It is a rather small city located on an island. The island is not too hot, not too cold. Climatically,
I would pin it in the neighborhood of a summer day in Ireland. Definitely not a tropical destination.

This city is one of four settlements that are on this Island and it serves as its center-piece,
with the other three villages being located by the sea shore, each connected with a single road to Yiandh.

Yiandh is a rather nice city, it has several small districts, each with its distinctive atmosphere.
The streets and the buildings are very clean and in a good shape, despite the fact that it is not a
metropolis like, say, Rome was.

Technologically, this city and the world in which it is located is not very advanced and could be more
likened to a medieval or a fantasy settings. Nevertheless, Yiandh is home to many wise scholars and quality
education, a favorable social system and a generally peaceful and relaxed disposition.

Religion reigns supreme in the city of Yiandh. The people worship one of the many world deities,
Xexanoth, but we will hear about this god more, when we get there. Yiandh's inhabitants are close with
the deity and attribute the good state of the city to a special kind of rain which Xexanoth supposedly
blesses the city with every once in a while. This rain is said to cleanse things, fix what is broken
and restore an object's novelty.

Several years ago, Xexanoth spoke to some of his followers through a dream and announced the advent
of a special woman of nontraditional looks, who would be an emissary to Yiandh, to anticipate her arrival
and ensure her a safe and pleasant stay.

Yiandh is governed by a council of representatives who are selected through democratic vote. Despite
the fact that anyone can elect to run for the office, most of the time the council consists of
scholars and high-ranking priests, in a roughly balanced ratio. Many years ago, a future precaution
has been taken and placed into the constitution of Yiandh - a ban of all political parties,
which mandates that individuals run for themselves, as themselves. There has, however, been no
need for this yet, as despite a steady slow growth, Yiandh is still too small.

So this was the map of Yiandh. I have another, but this one will be without such a long explanation,
as I have spoken about it before.

![Dead Whale Port](/media/dead_whale_port.png)

This is Dead Whale Port, a sheltered coast city where Fira Angelica and her crew stopped by on their
quest for immortality. It is located in a cove, which makes sure that the open sea in front of it is not,
in fact, that open.

Towards the inland, there are tall mountains, which protect Dead Whale Port from other sides, making
it a well-defended pirate sanctuary. Given its long history and natural protection, local government
has given up on trying to conquer the city, on the condition that Dead Whale Port will not be attacking
the inland. The pirates agreed.

As you can see on the map, there are only two egress roads from Dead Whale Port. Calling them roads
might a bit of an overstatement - a trail for experienced hikers might be more appropriate.

I have taken the liberty of marking a few important points referenced in the memory.

.

.

.

Alright, that might be it for now. But I think I'm going to take a break for a few minutes.
Brew myself a cup of coffee. I don't really need it to function, but it makes me feel nice.
Also, my eyes hurt a bit from staring into sheets for such a long time at once and jumping around
with my eyes so fast. Huh, could put on my glasses, then.

Let me quickly find them.

.

.

Hmm, where did I put them? No luck there ...

.

Oh, maybe these drawers? Not here... Not here either... Not there too.

.

Hmm...

.

Did I leave them on the...? No, I didn't.

.

.

Oh, wait, they are on my head. Huh, haha. I'm not very smart sometimes, take note of that,
dear listener.

Anyways, I'm off for a cup of coffee.

Alright, I'm back. I feel recharged. Yee-haw!

So, in a moment, we shall get back to the storytelling business. I was gone for a little longer than I expected, as is wont to happen
when you float off into your imagination in the kitchen, but I will probably cut the recording to make the pause not so long.

Now, you may be wondering how I managed to fit pictures into a sound recording. Well, it's magic and that makes it a magician's secret.
Thanks for asking.

However, I hope you appreciate my maps, I am really proud of them, they took a long time to make. I feel like cartography is a
neglected vocation, as these days, everyone just takes the availability of a good map for granted.

Anyways, I digress.

Let's get back to the storytelling.


# EPISODE 2: ZORA

> Do you not know that there comes a midnight hour when every one has to throw
off his mask? Do you believe that life will always let itself be mocked?
Do you think you can slip away a little before midnight in order to avoid this?
Or are you not terrified by it? I have seen men in real life who so long deceived
others that at last their true nature could not reveal itself;... In every man
there is something which to a certain degree prevents him from becoming perfectly
transparent to himself; and this may be the case in so high a degree, he may be
so inexplicably woven into relationships of life which extend far beyond himself
that he almost cannot reveal himself. But he who cannot reveal himself cannot love,
and he who cannot love is the most unhappy man of all.

In the city, a while ago.

Black soldiers are flooding through the streets. Nella is running as fast as she can.
She is an athletic-looking woman of rather slender build with short, dark-green hair.
Right now, Nella had her hair a little longer than usual, but she had plans to cut it once again.
Her eyes are gray, and there is evidence of a nose ring, but she isn't wearing it now.

She is currently in the western side of the city, but so far, she has no idea where to run.
The soldiers are firing and, in Nella's direction, there are live rounds flying as well, not just
non-lethal rubber balls.

Nella has bionic legs, installed after an accident which deprived her of her original ones. They allow
her to run faster and longer, jump higher and move with greater finesse than humans usually can.
She too is Modified.

Gunfire.

Nella turns a corner and curses herself for returning to The City. She received a letter that
there is a package waiting for her here, but after she got off the train a few minutes ago,
the city was in disarray and armored men are everywhere, firing at everyone and forcing them
back into the houses.

Nella didn't have a house here, she moved a few years ago when it seemed The City received a shock
it might never recover from. She was a dance teacher, a ballet dancer to be precise. Among others,
she taught Allie, the daughter of Katarina, who owned a bistro nearby to her current location.

It's also where Neiro used to work. The two had a... complex relationship, so to speak.

Nella's legs were strong enough to do away with pretty much anything, so she figured that
maybe she can break in and hide in there.

Alright, that means she needs to go left, then two blocks forward and take a right, eventually, she
will run past another train station and then to street 47, where the bistro is.

Run.

Run.

Run.

Good, she can see the bistro. There are scorch marks all over it, but it looks like someone did some
basic repairs to it at least.

Nella runs towards it. On her way, she goes past a blue butterfly, one with wings that have a dark edge.

She can see someone about to walk right past it. Walk is a strong word. She has crutches and her leg
is in a cast.

"What the hell is that woman doing there, why is she outside?" Nella thinks to herself.

Finally, at the bistro.

"What the hell are you doing, can't you see what's happening?" Nella yells over the gunfire.

The other woman is startled and trips, falling to the ground.

Nella makes a fast decision, she kicks in the door and grabs the woman, pulling her inside.

Then she quickly closes the door. The door won't stay closed since Nella kicked it. Damn.
She grabs a chair and props it up. It was one of the few chairs that looked to be in a good shape.
Then she flipped over a table and put it against the door too.

Meanwhile, the woman is on the floor holding her broken leg. It got hit by the door as Nella pulled
her in and hurts now.

Nella then, without saying anything, grabs the woman and drags her to a room in the back. It seems
like it served as a kitchen or a food storage room.

They both sat on the ground facing each other. Nella was leaning on a counter, the woman was against
the wall.

"What were you doing, why aren't you home? You have a broken leg for fuck's sake."

"I know, I am sorry, thanks for helping me. I don't have a home here, I traveled here with a fake
resident card," the woman explains.

"Why the hell would you do that?"

"You see, I have been ill for some time and a while ago, I had a surgery. They told me my leg
would work after it heals, that's why I got the cast. It's not actually broken. For a long time,
I dreamed of dancing, but there were no dancing schools back in Gan Adfeilion, and a friend told
me that there are good dancers here. So I traveled here and tried to find someone, but I found almost
no one, and those I did find rejected me." the woman explained, rather sadly.

"Bad friend," Nella responded. Usually at moments like these, she would like a cigarette, but
she has been trying to stay off them for a while now. It wasn't easy.

Yea, she is lighting a cigarette. A pull in and puff out the smoke. The other girl starts to cough.
There is a kind of innocence beaming from her face in Nella's eyes.

"You ever smoked?" she asks her.

"No, I haven't..."

"Drugs, drinking?"

"No..."

"Irresponsible sex?"

"No..."

"Murder, crime, deviancy?"

"I couldn't even if I wanted to, I was ill..."

"You are not cut out for The City, you shouldn't have come here," Nella finishes her questioning,
"this is not a nice place."

"Yea, I kinda figured, people weren't as nice to me as I expect it. When the gunfire started, it
was clear... is this normal?"

"There was a lot of dark stuff, but no, I haven't seen this before," Nella was becoming calm.

Then she continued: "I think we need to lie low for a while, hopefully, this will be over soon."

"Okay, it's not like I can escape anyway. My crutches are still outside," the woman responded.

"Fuck," Nella thought.

"Yea, I know what it's like when your legs don't work like they used to," Nella said, pulling up one
leg of her jeans to reveal that it is a mechanical prosthesis. She knocked on it to produce a loud
sound indicating hard materials in the shin.

"What happened?" the woman asked.

"Long story. What's your name?"

"Zora. I'm Zora. And you?"

"Nella."

Nella then got up and ran through the cup boards and cabinets. Some of them weren't burned as badly
as others. A few objects even looked new.

She found a bottle of scotch in one of them. She opened it, took a swig and then extended it to Zora.

Zora took a bigger swig than is generally a good idea for first time drinking, swallowed it, and then
let out a very strange sound.

Nella was bewildered.

Zora quickly became red in the face.

Nella sighed and took another swig. At least she didn't finish the cigarette.

"Do you know who those soldiers were?" Zora asked.

"No. No idea. I had a FINE life elsewhere and every time I dip my nose in here,
EVERYTHING GOES TO SHIT"

"Oh, sorry... why were you here?

"...someone left me a package, they wouldn't deliver it because there 'dangerous substances' in it,
so they left it here. I don't know what it was," Nella responded more calmly. She didn't want to yell
at the girl.

Only now, she was finally able to get a good look at her. She looked somewhere between twenty and twenty-five,
her eyes and hair brown, and she had a really good figure, reminiscent of the old Greek and Roman ideals of beauty.
She had a very attractive face, it looked serene and innocent. It was not the kind of beauty one would
want to get into bed, but a different kind, more holy, one that would inspire poets to write about love
and beauty, and lament the transience of youth.

After a moment, Nella spoke again: "Well, we need to figure out what to do next."

"Fight back?" Zora asked with a spark in her eyes.

Nella rolled her eyes in surprise.

"No, we wouldn't stand a chance."

She pulled out her cell phone, opened the address book and scrolled down to Neiro. Neiro didn't have
her number. Nella acquired it through Allie, who in turn acquired it from Katarina, who got it from Neiro
herself through a letter. She wanted to call for a long time, but she just couldn't get herself to do it.
She kept postponing it over and over again, until she got here, now.

Right now, Neiro was the only person in the city she knew. She didn't have a number for anyone else. She
was the only person she could call.

So she took a deep breath and pressed dial.

...

No reception. She sighed and said: "We got no reception, we can't call anyone."

Zora asked: "Is that bad?"

"Very."

Nella then went to explore the bistro. She had no idea what she was looking for, but she was hoping
it would be something that could help her.

She spotted a box of old electronics upstairs. Some of them were a little melted. An idea started to form
itself.

Nella then ran over to the breaker box, and then checked if there ever was a television, by checking for an
antenna socket. There was.

There was a scientific element to Nella. She was partial mostly to chemistry, but she had some knowledge of
physics and biology as well. At this moment, it was time for this side to shine.

Maybe she could fashion a... Hmm... yes, indeed.

.

.

.

Elsewhere, Jake was starting to wake up. He felt horrible, all of his limbs were weak and his head hurt.

He opened his eyes, everything was still blurry, but it was slowly starting to sharpen.

There was someone sitting next to his bed.

It was the Boss. His hand was still bleeding. He was reading an old copy of The Whale by Herman Melville.
This was a very old edition, from year 1851, when the book was first published in London as three volumes.
These were these three volumes joined together. Later the book's title was changed to a more obviously eponymous
one. Under the new name, this was perhaps the most famous piece of American literature - despite the fact
that initial reception was better anywhere outside the US - and one of the most famous stories in the world.

It was of course, smudged with the same dirty blood.

"Hello, Jake, glad to see you awake. I was worried about you. I'm not sure if you remember, but the helicopter
was shot down and you got hit on your way down. Lost a lot of blood," the boss said.

"Boss, hello..." responded Jake. He was still a little confused, and he didn't remember getting shot.

Then he suddenly realized: "What about the other guy, is he fine?"

"William? He landed in the city, he got hurt as well, and he was a little banged up from the landing, too.
Morpho found and brought him back only a few minutes ago. He is unconscious right now, he is in another room.
They told me you might wake up soon, so I came here."

"Where are we...?" Jake was still a little dazed.

"Oh, I had you moved while you were out. I brought more manpower, work is going much faster. We were able
to construct several buildings already."

Jake noticed he was in a metallic building made out of plates and steel beams. The insides of the walls were padded
with some insulation material.

"You have surely noticed them. They are the strange armored clad-in-black folk. Oh, before anything else...
I'm really sorry about what happened to you, I did not expect that there would be someone in The City,
who could take down a helicopter that high. I would like to make it up to you if I can. I brought you
some stuff."

He puts a bag on the night stand. He pulls out a small gold bar. "First this, it's a bonus for your
trouble. It's 200 grams, should help with finances."

Then he pulls out a strange pendant. It is somewhat large and it consists of five parts. A plate,
possibly silver or another metal, and two metallic bars on each side.

"This is a very special necklace, it will grant you protection when you will need it."

And finally, he pulls out a two bananas.

"Calcium," the boss exclaims with a smile.

"Thanks boss, I appreciate the care, but this really shook me, man. I don't think I can do anything
as dangerous as that anymore."

"I understand, nothing like that anymore, I promise," the boss said, doing a thumbs up gesture, "I need to get
going now, so take care, cheers!" The boss then got up and went to leave the room, waving a hand at Jake.

Jake decided to get up and go for a walk through the building. Walking was a little hard for him.

He went into the hallway. There were several rooms, most of them were labeled by its function. He decided
to go into the canteen room, he wanted to drink some tea.

He opened the door and went in. No one here, or so he thought. He went to the wall to grub a cup, filled it
with tea.

Took a sip. "I had better than this, but I suppose it is drinkable," he thought. He took another sip.

Then he turned around.

There was a naked woman standing near one of the tables. She was taking a look at her dress. It was
like a ball, ornate black dress, with several gemstone brooches of different colors. She had red eyes
with triangular pupils and a black choker.

As soon as Jake realized what he is looking at, he covered his eyes and shouted: "Oh my god, I'm so
sorry, I had no idea!"

The woman turns around looking perplexed: "Hi, sorry about what?"

"Well, you are naked and I had no idea you are here, and... Jeez, I'm so sorry."

"Is that something to be sorry about? Which part? Isn't it normal to be naked?"

"Uh... I mean I guess. It's just, people don't like to normally be seen naked unless by people they like, I guess?"

"Aha, I see. Are you a people I like?"

"I don't know, I don't think so, I've never met you."

"I see. Take off your hands, I want to take a look at you. You can look."

Jake did as she asked. The woman was about 170cms tall, had black hair in what appeared like a french bob,
but what would have been her bangs were combed back. She had a slim but well-balanced build, with athletic
looking legs, in which one could see hints of muscles. Jake was doing his best not to stare at her chest,
which, although not that big, had a very fine shape.

"You are blond," the woman exclaimed.

"Yes, but couldn't you have seen that even when I was covering my eyes?" Jake was able to get back to his
usual self a little.

"Your eyes are blue."

"Yes, and yours are red, which is very strange."

"I have always had these eyes"

"Okay... what's your name, anyway?"

"Don't have one, what's yours?"

"I'm Jake, what do you mean you don't have a name?"

"Hello, Jake... Never had one. What name do I look like to you?"

"What do you mean 'what name you look like to me'?"

"If you just saw me, and had to think of a name, what would it be?"

"I don't know, are you sure you don't have one?"

"Yes, I never had one. I'm as I am, I am my own, only for a short while."

"Were you a slave or anything?" At this point, nothing would surprise Jake.

"No, it was more like I was, developing. And serving a purpose. When I developed to
a certain point, it was time for me to leave my birthplace. A new one shall take my place eventually."

"Alright, that is for sure confusing."

"So, what name do I looked like to you?" The woman went over to Jake and stared him into the eyes.

"Uh.. I don't know?" Jake was perplexed.

"Come on. There has to be a name," the woman said. She was staring intently and curiously at Jake.
He was a little disturbed by this, but also started getting used to the oddity of the situation.

"Hmm, I don't know, Alice? I really feel like I'm in Wonderland," Jake said jokingly.

"Alice sounds like a nice name. Thank you," said the woman, then she added, "Hello Jake, I'm Alice"

"Hi?" there was something about this strange woman for Jake.

"I hear people generally shake hands when they meet," Alice said, extending her hand.

"They usually do, but it's the other hand, not left," Jake then extended his right hand, Alice switched,
and shook hand, grabbing it very firmly in the process.

"Wow, this lady has a lot more force than she looks like," Jake thought.

"Can you help me with my dress? I have never worn anything before, I am not sure how to get
back into it."

"Don't you put on underwear first?"

"No."

"Okay then, sure. Why do you wear this strange dress here, don't you have like overalls or anything?"

"No, I wear it because I have to. I took it from the river."

"The river?" Jake was once again bewildered.

"Yes, the stones too."

"Okay," Jake said, "this woman must be a little crazy," he thought.

Alice then said: "Thank you... Jake."

.

.

.

Elsewhere, Neiro was very angry. She had overcome the initial shock of what happened in last hours,
and the grief and shock turned to anger, per usual.

She slammed the imitation leather above the glove compartment several times. Sometimes, she let out
an angry tear.

Horus was in the back checking on Loki. Loki was still unconscious, but it looked like the fever was
better, his pupils were also a little less dilated.

"Neiro, come over here, to the container," Horus yelled out. The soldiers were shuffling around far enough
not to hear them here in the industrial zone.

Neiro was pissed, but she decided to listen. If eyes could throw lightning, then one Neiro right now would
be good enough to solve the world's energy problems.

She went inside the container and Horus threw a bag of chips at her: "Eat, you are short and light,
you should eat something, who knows what is going to happen, you should have some energy. I would make
better food, but it would take time."

Neiro threw an angry look at Horus and snapped: "I'm not short!". She then opened the bag and started munching
loudly, angrily staring into the wall.

Horus took of his coat, underneath it, he had a white shirt and a red tie. Even through the shirt,
Neiro could spot a large bruise on his shoulder. That was because the shirt was stuck to this shoulder,
the armpits, and a small part of the back, by sweat. The shoulder was the one he carried Loki on, which is probably
when it became sweaty.

He could spot Neiro looking staring at his shoulder: "Oh this, it will be fine, I just need to massage it
a little. Don't worry. I got hit on our way to the truck."

Horus took off the tie and laid it on one of the shelves in the container, then he started unbuttoning his shirt.

When he took it off, Neiro was shocked. She could see what seemed like dozens of bullet hole scars and several
large scars from bladed weapons. His left arm had bad burn scars all the way from the wrist to halfway between shoulder
and elbow. The hand was fine.

"What... happened?" Neiro asked, completely staggered by what she was saying.

"It's a long story. Especially the arm. I was a little close to the light, one might say," Horus answered.

But in his mind, he started to recall the events. Maybe it was time for him to tell a story as well.


# MEMORY 2: HORUS

Many years ago. Inside a forest of a more tropical variety, but not a rain forest. There is a shack nearby.
It is night.

The forest is on fire.

A noticeably younger Horus is standing in a heavily damaged uniform stained with blood stains. Ten meters
in front of him stands a man in a similar state. He looks about fifteen years older and there is a patch
with a strange animal on his uniform. It looks a bit like a donkey, a bit like an aardvark, a bit like a
jackal and maybe as a fennec fox too.

Around them, there lie dozens of bodies, about half of them in a uniform same as Horus's, the other
half matches the other man.

The only weapons Horus and the man have left are knifes. The fire rages.

"Stop, there is no point in this! You've lost, there is more of us coming," yells Horus.

"You know I can't stop. I am not giving back what is rightfully mine."

"Yours? You are nothing but a usurper."

"Me a usurper? I am the liberator, I stopped that old fool for the people. You should
know that it couldn't have continued like this."

"You killed him. He trusted you. He had his faults, but he was a good man. You are
a tyrant."

"I am no tyrant. But the people were blind, they need someone to set them on the right path."

"Not like this."

Horus and the man start getting closer and circling each other, each with a knife in their hand.

"There was no other way."

"You are a fool."

"It is you who is the fool, Horus. You are living in a dream, an illusion of ideals. You too are
blind, everyone is. Their eyes are yet to open."

"No, there are better ways to conduct yourself."

"I would say that this will be your undoing someday, but the day is today."

"Stop, you don't have to do this. You've lost, can't you see the corpses? They are all dead,
the forest is on fire. You are the destroyer of worlds!"

"If your leader and you guys hadn't come to oppose me, none of this would have happened."

The fire surges, internal and external temperature rising. Sweat mixes with the blood of the fallen,
and their own.

"If we hadn't come, the future would lead to ruin."

"That's what you think, but you are blind. You lot waltzed in here and shat on everything I built.
Who is the bad guy here?"

"You usurper claim to have built something worthwhile? Bold of you to say that."

"Yes, it is only rational, you blind fool. That is it, your idealism falls short in the face of
rationality. If only you were rational, you would have seen the meaning of my words."

"Only tyrants shield themselves with axiomatic rationality."

"But boundless idealism leaves a trail of blood. Have you seen the history!? Which was it,
endless idealism or rigid rationality which produced more corpses. And yet idealistic ideologs
are not shunned unlike the rationalists."

"That is true, they are both bloody when unchecked. But that is why you need both, to balance
each other out. That is why you need a third a value atop of these two. He figured it out.
That you need to pay attention, and to be vigilant. Wary of things. You are the blind one"

"Perhaps he wasn't as vigilant, if he let me get to him. But do you really think I'm the blind one?"

The men are a few steps closer. The fire rages, each of them is grasping his knife with
anticipation. Sweat glistens with a shade of red. A combination of the light from the
fire, dirt, blood and sweat makes it seem as if the men were much more tanned than they are.
A lighter line underneath their hairline betrays just how much dirt each one has on them.

"Yes, no one more than you. You destroyed the land, you injured the people. You set
everyone years back."

"That is foolish and shortsighted."

"And irredeemable acts are what?"

"They were for the greater good."

"And what good was that? A very nice road to hell? Well congrats, your good intentions
make for a great pavement."

"I hate you"

"The world has turned, and many have burned. But you are to blame!"

"A blame? There is no blame! It's either all of us or no one. Do you think that a single
man can do this all by himself? If you really think I'm evil... and if you are looking for
someone to blame... then you only need to look into a mirror, just like everybody else."

"There will never be an understanding between us."

"And that is why we must fight. Can you feel the heat? The temperature's rising! I'll make you bleed"

"I hate you."

"That's the spirit! Come at me, Horus! Let's see who is right! It's the most noble tradition.
Two men with blades settling their arguments with blood! The oldest form of argument on Earth!
FIGHT ME, HORUS!"

The man lunged at Horus with his knife, Horus parried the hit and struck back with left fist,
narrowly missing the face but striking the man in the shoulder.

The other one stumbled back two steps, regained his posture and stabbed at Horus again.

The fire rages, trees crackle, the shed caught on fire as well. It is an inferno.

Horus blocked the hit by stopping the hand under his wrist and kicked the man in the stomach.
The man receded from Horus and Horus lunged with his knife forward.

The man deflected his hit, catching his arm with his free hand, and stabbed back. Horus
caught the stabbing hand as well.

The two men were now locked, each trying to overpower the other one. They were pretty well-balanced.
It was perhaps why they were the last ones standing.

The only difference between them was in age and rank. The man was the usurper, the tyrant leader. Horus
was just a warrior who came here with his revolutionary leader, who was now lying lifeless on the ground
with many holes all over his body.

The reverse tug-of-war ended when the man tripped Horus and both of them fell to the ground,
rolling over.

They ended up lying next to each other. The man tried to stab Horus in the chest, but he missed
and ended up producing a large gash in Horus's side. Horus barely felt it with the adrenalin
and the heat.

The shack was very well on fire at this point. The forest now looked nothing like it used to,
and perhaps even Inferno itself would find the scorching heat too much.

Horus rolled back, to be back on his feet, but crouched. He went after the man and managed to punch him
in the head, breaking his nose, which led to more blood streaming down his face.

The man grabbed some dirt from the ground and threw it in Horus's face. Horus was temporarily blinded.
The man lunged after Horus, stabbing him two times in his left leg, in the thigh and in the foot. There
was also a cut across his shin from a failed stab attempt.

Both of the men had already other wounds from the previous combat. They were a boiling bloody mess.

Horus kicked the man back and got up. The other man also started getting up, but Horus jumped at him, plunging
his knife in the man's back all the way to the hilt.

The usurper started swinging at Horus and then managed to embed his knife in Horus's other thigh.

_Mano-a-mano_. Now the fists were the only weapon left.

They both started swinging at each other.

Left hook to Horus's face.

Right hook to Horus's stomach.

Left hook to the usurper's solar plexus.

Right hook to the usurper's jaw.

Headbutt to Horus's forehead.

Kick to the usurper's shin.

Shove. Both fell to the ground and roll over. Horus tries to strangle the usurper. The usurper punches him to the
head and gains upper head.

A punch to Horus's right eye.

A punch to Horus's right eye.

A punch to Horus's right eye.

Roll over.

The shack has collapsed under the fire. It's now just a flaming pile.

Horus gains the upper hand.

Left hook.

Right hook.

Left hook.

Right hook.

Left hook.

Right hook.

Horus's gloves are bloodied, but the other man still isn't down. He manages to hit Horus back, creating
an opening he uses to throw him back, to put some distance between themselves.

The men get back up to their feet, with great difficulty. They are both panting, injured and exhausted.

For the last time, they lock into each other and try to get the other one down.

"DIE, HORUS!"

Horus doesn't respond and just snarls at the usurper.

They are close to the blazing remnants of the shack.

Each of them pushes as strong as they can to get the upper hand.

Horus is stronger.

He grunts loudly and shoves the usurper into the fire, using his left arm to hold him there.

The man contorts and screams and tries to fight back.

Horus won't let go.

The skin on Horus's arm starts to crack, boil, and burn away.

There is wrath in both of the mens' eyes.

A smell of burnt flesh starts to fill the air.

A few seconds later, the screams stop and the usurpers hands fall back into the fire as well.

Horus stumbles back a few steps and falls to the ground. It is done.

The man is done.

Horus is done.

He is never coming back to this, he can't.

Horus is done. This was the end.

He lies on the ground, arms and legs stretched out. There is not a hint
of strength in any limb.

He looks at the sky. It is clear, the stars are visible. Observing,
maybe judging, looking down on Horus. He used to look at them a lot
back then. They were fascinating.

Everything would change in his early life. Places would change, enemies
would change, people would change, times would change, even. But not the
stars.

Every time he would look at the sky, he would see the same stars, and the same
moon. It was one of the few constants he had. They had such soft light.

They shimmer and glimmer and they look so tiny. And the moon, like a shepherd
to his herd of stars would keep closing and opening his one big eye.

"It is funny," he thought, "that some things look much clearer in the dark."

He didn't hear the fire right now. He didn't see it either. There were only
the stars and their tiny little dance across the night sky.

It reminded him of old times, and he started to tear up a little.

A warrior since he could remember, a child soldier.

He knew the man he just killed. And in his way, he loved the man.

He was like a father, or perhaps more accurately, an uncle to him.

He would make sure Horus was fed as a child, he would share his bread, and
his water.

He would tell him stories and speak about the world. He would look at the
sky and point out the constellations.

When they were hiding from the regime in mountains, he would play cards with
Horus and teach him games.

He would give him advice and help him become stronger.

He would teach him how to fight, how to hold a weapon, and how to stand for
what he believes in.

He was an uncle, and a mentor, and a friend. One of the few who came back
from every incursion.

Horus wonders why it had to be this way. Why there came such a divide.

He hoped that hatred might some day replace the pain, but it never goes away.
It makes a man hideous, inside and out. It feels like the old humanity won't return.
And all that stays is the demon.

Yet, staring across this wasted scorching land, it feels like a new life will be born,
beneath the bloodstained sand.

It may seem like there is no tomorrow, but there is still hope for the future. In
the struggle to survive the present, man pushes the future farther away. But there
is no time to waste.

Someday, the world will no longer need them: no need for the gun, or the hand to pull
the trigger. He has to drag out the demon inside him; build a better future. That's
what he- what _we_ leave as our legacy.

And yet, Horus would rather have his friend back. Is it foolish?

The tears evaporate quickly, and as gas, they fly up to the sky.

Horus has won, but in a sense he also died.

He can't do this anymore. He is done, he quits.

No more usurper... and no more resistance fighter.

He lies looking at the moon. It is sharp and blurry at the same time.
Obscured and clear. It's the images of his left eye and his right eye merged
together. The healthy, and the sick.

Bloodied Horus closes his eyes and starts to fall asleep, maybe unconscious.

Far away, men rushing towards the fire can be heard.

The others have come.


# MIST

A man steps inside the room. A wooden chair.

He sits in it.

.

Jay wakes up in the bistro feeling kinda odd. He is a man dealing information for a living.
His job is to dig up dirt, spy on people, then sell it to the highest bidder.

He is twenty-something, about 193 centimeters tall, green-eyed, a redhead,
and he reeks of cigarettes.

Which is how he shall start his day.

Open lighter. Spark. Ignite. Partake.

He can do a lot of these for a day. These are obviously not good for his lungs,
or the lungs of anyone in his vicinity.

Today is a pretty uneventful day. It is quite warm today, so he does not really have to
dress up that much. A basic pair of pants, a T-shirt, a sweatshirt are good enough. And a beanie,
it wouldn't be a proper Jay outfit without it.

He leaves the bistro mouthing a "hi" to Katarina on the way.

It's a few minutes to the train station. He boards the train and leaves it in a station close
to the river. Jay has some errands to run there.

He is meeting a "client" on the waterfront. It is a pretty safe place because most don't dare
to cross you in a public place like this. And there is a lot of people on the waterfront today.

Jay steps in to a puddle. Huh, he wasn't paying attention, he thinks. His left shoe apparently
had a hole in it. Who knows if he knew about it before, but now he does.

Suddenly, something caught his eye. It's the girl from yesterday. She is sleeping on a bench.
Not a good place to stay in The City.

Jay goes over to her and starts shaking her, trying to get her to wake up.

"Hey!" he yells.

"Hey!"

She finally starts to respond and answers, a bit dazed: "What is going on?"
She immediately starts looking a bit panicky and patting herself all over.

"Why are you looking so frightened? Somebody robbed you?" Jay says with a snarky smile.

"Yea, I don't have my phone and money," she says with a frown, "What do you want from me?"

Jay sighs.

"You can't sleep on a bench like this. You were lucky, next time, someone could come kill you."

Frowning again, the girl answered: "And what am I supposed to do? I have nowhere to go... And it's not
your problem, mind your business."

"Chill out," Jay rolls his eyes. "Exactly, I want to offer you a job and a shelter. But I'm in a hurry to
my own work. Take it or leave it."

"What job and what shelter?" the girl asks with a tone of suspicion in her voice.

"The work is in a bistro, all sorts of stuff, it used to be a guesthouse too, so there is a plenty of
rooms free. I live there and sometimes help out with stuff."

Jay throws away a cigarette butt, steps on it and leaves it there. He immediately takes out
another one and lights it.

"Well... I guess okay, it's just that, I'm not adult yet."

"Doesn't matter, I went there at sixteen," Jay answers, "Hey, I really gotta go. But you go there,
it's on the corner of street 47, you go this way, over there, then right, then you go on and on,
until you see a bistro with a red sign. Ask for a Katarina and tell her I sent you. It should be okay."

The girl was a little confused but answered "O-ok, alright."

Jay then leaves her.

Suddenly a large truck appears in one of the side alleys going at full speed.

It hits Jay, he and the truck both fly into the river.

.

Jay wakes up in the bistro feeling very strange.

Open lighter. Spark. Ignite. Partake.

He can do a lot of cigarettes in a day.

Today is a pretty uneventful day. It is quite warm today, so he does not really have to
dress up that much. A basic pair of pants, a T-shirt, a sweatshirt are good enough. And a beanie,
it wouldn't be a proper Jay outfit without it.

He leaves the bistro mouthing a "hi" to Katarina .

It's a while to the train station. He boards a train and leaves it in a station by the river.
Jay has some errands to run there.

He is meeting a "client" on the waterfront. It is a pretty safe place because most don't dare
to cross you in a public place like this. And there is a lot of people on the waterfront today.

Jay steps in to a puddle. Huh, he wasn't paying attention, he thinks. His left shoe apparently
had a hole in it. Who knows if he knew about it before, but now he does.

Suddenly, something caught his eye. It's the girl from yesterday. She is sleeping on a bench.
Not a good place to stay in The City.

Jay goes over to her and starts shaking her, trying to get her to wake up.

"Hey!" he yells.

"Hey! Are you on a bench again?"

She finally starts to respond and answers, a bit dazed: "Again? What is going on?"
She immediately starts looking a bit panicky and patting herself all over.

Jay is a bit confused. It feels like a deja vu.

"Why are you looking so frightened? Somebody robbed you?" Jay says with a snarky smile.
His smile quickly freezes though, something nags his mind.

"Yea, I don't have my phone and money," she responds with a frown, "What do you want from me?"

Jay sighs, but feels strange.

"You can't sleep on a bench like this. You were lucky, next time, someone could come kill you."

Frowning again, the girl answered: "And what am I supposed to do? I have nowhere to go... And it's not
your problem, mind your business."

"Chill out," Jay rolls his eyes but freezes for a second. "Exactly, I want to offer you a job and a shelter.
But I'm in a hurry to my own work. Take it or leave it."

"What job and what shelter?" the girl asks with a tone of suspicion in her voice.

"The work is in a bistro, all sorts of stuff, it used to be a guesthouse too, so there is a plenty of
rooms free. I live there and sometimes help out with stuff."

Jay throws away a cigarette butt, steps on it and leaves it there. He immediately takes out

"Well... I guess okay, it's just that, I'm not adult yet."

"Doesn't matter, I went there at sixteen," Jay answers, "Hey, I really gotta go. But you go there,
it's on the corner of street 47, you go this way, over there, then right, then you go on and on,
until you see a bistro with a red sign. Ask for a Katarina and tell her I sent you. It should be okay."

The girl was a little confused but answered "O-ok, alright."

Jay then leaves her.

Suddenly a large truck appears in one of the side alleys going at full speed.

Jay tries to dodge it, but he can't. Both he and the truck fly into the river.

.

Jay wakes up in the bistro and feels very disturbed.

Open lighter. Spark. Ignite. Partake.

He can do a lot of cigarettes in a day.

Wait, hasn't he done this before, he thinks. Like exactly the same way?

He starts remembering. He puts on his clothes quickly and runs to the station.

Jay leaves the train in a station near the river and runs out of it quickly.

Jay steps in to a puddle. Huh, he wasn't paying attention, he thinks. His left shoe apparently
had a hole in it. Who knows if he knew about it before, but now he does.

Wait, he already knows about the hole, he thinks. This is weird.

He runs over to the girl and shakes.

"Hey! HEY! I SAID HEY! WAKE UP!" he yells out of his lungs.

The girl is scared and confused.

"NEIRO, WAKE UP!" Jay remembered the name.

Neiro looks like she has no idea what's going on.

"What the hell is going on Neiro? Why are we here again?!"

"What do you want from, me, I don't know anything. How do you know my name?!" Neiro responds
in an angry tone.

"I'm Jay, don't you recognize me?"

"Well, you are the guy from yesterday?"

"No, I. Am. Jay. We've been together. Smoking cigarettes and stuff? You remember, no?" Jay is starting
to plead with Neiro.

"I'm sorry."

"What the hell?" Jay yells and throws his hands.

Suddenly a large truck appears in one of the side alleys going at full speed.

Jay tries to dodge it, but he can't. Both he and the truck fly into the river.

.

Jay wakes up in the bistro and runs out, without even putting on clothes.

He runs to the river as fast as he can. Fuck trains. He just runs as fast as he can.

It takes a while, but he doesn't care and just pushes his body to the limit. If he hadn't
been smoking, he would have been a better runner.

Jay turns a sharp corner.

A moment later, he steps in to a puddle. He has no shoes on.

He runs over to the Neiro and starts shaking her and yelling.

"NEIRO! YOU BITCH! DID YOU DO THIS TO ME? WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!"

Neiro quickly wakes up and is very scared.

"No, what is going on? No, what? What? I have no idea what..."

"DON'T LIE, THERE HAS TO BE A REASON!"

Neiro escapes his tight grip and runs a way. Jay runs after her.

Suddenly a large truck appears in one of the side alleys going at full speed.

Jay tries to dodge it, but he can't. Both he and the truck fly into the river.

.

Jay steps in to a puddle. He has no shoes on. He feels like he is crazy.

He runs over to the Neiro and starts shaking her.

"Neiro! Please, let me out, I beg you. Please"

Neiro quickly wakes up and is very confused.

"What is going on? The hell? What? I have no idea what you..."

"Please, just please, I have no idea what is going on," Jay tries to plead with her.

Neiro jerks away from Jay.

"I'm sorry, I have no idea what you are talking about," Neiro says in a weirded out tone.

Suddenly a large truck appears in one of the side alleys going at full speed.

Jay tries to run away from it, but no luck. Both he and the truck fly into the river.

.

Jay wakes up in the bistro and runs over to the river.

On his way, he steps in to a puddle. He has no shoes on.

"Neiro? Please, what do I have to do for this to end?"

Neiro is just slowly starting to wake up.

"What? I'm sorry, who are you? How do you know my name?"

Jay feels defeated, steps away from Neiro and throws his hands.

Suddenly a large truck appears in one of the side alleys going at full speed.

Jay doesn't even try running away from it. Both he and the truck fly into the river.

.

Jay wakes up in the bistro and runs over to the river.

On his way, he steps in to a puddle. He falls into it, sinks in and it looks to him as if he was sinking
in the sea.

"Jay?" he hears a man's voice.

"Jaaaay?"

.

Suddenly, the sea is starting to fade, and he starts to come to his senses in a corner of a dimly lit room.

He only has basic clothes on him.

In the room, there are two basic wooden chairs. There is man sitting on one of it.

"Rise and shine, moonshine," the man says.

"Hello? Where am I?"

"Howdy Jay, I'm mag. I'm afraid you are in hell."

"Hell? What? This must be some kind of trick, right? Do you work with Antonio?"

"I'm afraid not, and I don't know your Antonio, probably."

"I don't believe you."

"That's fine. Now, Jay, do you know why you are here? Just like others, it is by thine hand.
However, you are special. You do not belong to this Hell. Although... I feel like 'Hell' is a criminally
dramatic term for an after-life rehabilitation center."

"What?"

"Good answer. Now, you are here because there has been a trade. My counterpart from your world sent you
over to me because I'm interested in The City. He said that you trade information and according to the visions
you were having right now, it seems like it indeed."

"What? Why are you interested in The City? Visions?"

"Yes, visions were what you were having right now. It's the effect of the air here, and the mist. It makes
you reflect on what you have done in your life that led you here."

"I don't understand... I don't believe you."

"Like I said, that's fine. It's not like it changes anything. However, I am interested in The City. And
to quote a certain wise man: 'What champion demands service without recompense? Clearly, you are not that sort of
man', and I am neither a champion, nor that sort of man. So I'm willing to give you a deal, if you give me some
information."

"Please anything, anything, so I don't have go back. Do you want to know about Neiro, Valentine? I'll tell you everything
just please."

"Who the hell is Neiro? Or Valentine? These are not the people I want to meet. Now, start spilling the beans. Tell me
everything you know, everything you gathered during your time in The City."

And so Jay did, he started spilling his guts out. Telling everything he knew about everyone and everything up until
the moment he ended his life. Oh... he ended his life. Maybe this man isn't lying, he thought.

Jay saw that this man looked very strange. He had red eyes with a triangular pupil, he was clad in black, wore a hat
and his face was obscured by the hat and an impenetrable shadow that it produced. The only thing that went through it
was the shine of his red eyes.

Jay explained everything and went into as much detail as he could. Sadly, there wasn't enough information about that
person. Jay only met them briefly. But he spilled everything he knew about Neiro, Valentine and others.

"Odd," mag thought. "If I was with this Antonio guy, this would constitute a pretty hard betrayal."

It felt like hours. And probably it was. Jay didn't want to go back, so he kept going on and on for as long as he
could.

But eventually, the end finally came. Jay had nothing else to say.

"Hey wait, there is definitely more I can say. Just let me think for a moment."

"You've said that many times. I'm afraid the river's run dry. Speaking of which... interesting river
you got there. Curious."

mag put his hand up, and quickly shook it. Seemingly out of his sleeve flew a cigarette. Jay wanted it.
He tried to reach for it and said: "Can I?"

mag pulled away and said with a sly smile: "Nope. These are bad. These kill you, you know? It's one thing to
keep in mind for your future life... whatever that means. I think you had enough of these in life."

"No, no, no... Okay, okay. Now, I've told you everything, will you let me out of here?"

"Oh, I'm not keeping you here. See? The door is not locked," mag said, pointing at the wooden door to this
concrete cube.

"But you are not escaping from here, I'd say."

Jay yelled "No" and ran through to the door. On his way, he tried to punch mag, and even though his it went straight
to mag's face, he didn't hit anything. It just felt like he stirred up mist or vapor when he went through mag.

And when he looked at him, he saw that it was just like that. mag's head was split in two, but looked like mist.

Jay didn't care and just ran through the door.

Outside, the skies were gray and the atmosphere was misty. As far as eye could see were the same small concrete
houses. Basically cubes.

They were partially covered with vines whose roots ran everywhere on the ground.

Jay was on something that looked like a main road, so he thought that if he just keeps running on it, that he
will eventually reach an exit, border or something.

And so he ran, and ran, and ran.

After some time running, he couldn't anymore, and so he stopped to catch breath.

"Nice running form," he could suddenly here from this sight. \*Clap, clap, clap\*

mag was sitting on the roof of one of the cubes next to Jay.

"How the hell?" Jay exclaimed, panting.

"Oh, Hell has nothing to do with this, Jay. This is my handy work."

"I want out of here."

"Like I said, I'm not keeping you here. You are," mag said pointing at Jay's chest.

"Look that way. I give it a few seconds, tops. This is the only way to leave this place."

mag pointed to some far-off place. Jay looked in that direction as well.

Nothing happened for a few seconds.

Then a flash and a pillar of golden light appeared and briefly disappeared again.

"See, this is the only way. It's in your mind. You have to repent. Now, me just telling you this
is a major help on my part."

"But you promised... You lied to me"

"I didn't promise I would let you out of here. And I didn't lie to you. I cannot lie, it's the curse of
the Hell's administrator. _He who rules over liars cannot be a liar himself._ The only thing I can do is obscure
wording and obscure action. Maybe a ploy in a joke. That's it. Physically impossible."

"One day you will rot in Hell, too..." Jay felt betrayed.

"Oh, I won't. You ever hear of after-life for the so-called gods? No? Well, that's because there isn't any.
You die, your essence is dispersed into the air. That's it, bye-bye. No Hell, and... __There is no Heaven out there for me...__"
mag ended looking a little melancholic.

"So what can you give me then?"

"I will honor my promise. I am a devil of my word, so to speak, haha."

"How?" Jay was done with mag's antics.

"A little brazen now, are we? I can't let you out, so I will promise you the opposite. I will keep you in here.
That is, you here instead of the Hell back in your world. Now, trust me, I'm much more lenient and non-torturing
than my counterpart. So you can do your penance here, in relative peace and through my methods, which are more...
rehabilitative than punishing... and then you will be free. Same rule as for everybody."

"What's the catch?"

"Smart man. The catch is that this is a different world than your original. All the people you spoke about...
You won't meet them here in the after-life, or anywhere else. Then again, if you go back, it might take
many years before you get to meet them again, if ever. And they might not be happy to see you, or they might
be very different to what you remember... So, which is it?"

Jay stayed silent for a few seconds.

"I'm staying here."

"Very well, then. Pleasure doing business with you. I'll be going, then. And remember... repent, sinner, repent..."

...

"Oh, before I go. I thought that I could have something more 'materialistic' for you."

mag reaches into a dark corner of the room and pulls out a guitar, seemingly out of the wall.

"Something to pass the time while you think."

mag then left.

And Jay took the guitar and played.

# EPISODE 2: ZORA

Elsewhere, some time before evening.

Endell is starting to come to, he can vaguely hear voices and movement. His ears are ringing and his head hurts,
but it starts to subside quickly.

He can feel someone slapping lightly him from side to side.

Someone speaks: "Hey, Endell, hello. Mr. Gildner? Earth calls..." It's Voss.

Endell finally opens his eyes and notices he is bound to the wall and gagged.

"Hello, finally..."

Endell starts to voice his disapproval and possibly threaten the man, but he can't say much through the gag.

"I don't believe we have been properly acquainted... yet. My name is Voss."

Voss turns on his heel.

"For a long time... I have been a fan of what you've done with the city. Years ago. You truly show the
potential a Modified man has in the world... Such a shame that you have turned away from the light later on..."

Voss turns on his heel.

"Nevertheless... Antonio, your brother, has been a great inspiration to me. He truly pushed humanity as a species...
My other inspiration has been Simon Mann... Thanks to him, we know how to run a private military group... Unfortunately,
I don't think he would have approved of our methods..."

Endell does his best to communicate his hatred for Voss at least through eyes.

"I know, I know... you are gagged. But... you have to understand. Quite a handful you were."

Endell started to look around the room. He could see that he was in an old abandoned building, there was a window, so it
wasn't underground. By the noise and the view, it was probably a second floor or thereabouts. Other than that, the room
was somewhat rudimentary. Only basic appliances present, along with a small stash of weaponry.

Next he looked at the man. Voss had a cape reminiscent of a raincoat, but the plastic was a bit thicker and it
really was just a cape with a hood. On his side, he had a blood bag attacked. There was some writing on it,
Endell could make out the text "18WK" on it.

"Well, the thing is... I want to return the world some of its former glory... To that end, I need some special help, I would
call it..."

He then turns on his heel again.

"A help from a special kind of Modified. You know them right? You are close to two of them..."

Turn on heel again.

"I was hoping to get the girl, too... Sadly, only you were home... And I know you know the black kid too."

Endell angrily snarls at Voss.

"I know... what you must be saying. It's 'My friends will find me, and rescue me. I will be let loose and I will shove up
that gas mask up your ass'. Or something like that. Right?"

Voss comes over to Endell and runs his hand through his hair, squishing his cheeks.

"I am looking forward to that... It's why I left a calling card at Minerva's. So that your friends know precisely where
we are. Now you may be wondering-"

One of the grunts comes in and interrupts Voss mid-sentence: "Sir, there is some child on our compound going through our
garbage. What do we do about that?"

Voss: "Ah... unfortunate. I will handle it. We will pick up in a bit, Endell."

Voss then leaves the room, taking out his engraved M9A1, turning off safety.

...

The doors open and Voss comes out of it, going straight to the garbage containers. There was a little girl,
about ten years old, rummaging through one of them.

She immediately jerked away and crawled up to the wall when she saw Voss.

He then pointed his handgun at her.

"Hello little one... seems like natural selection is not in your favor today."

Voss then extends his hand forward and puts his finger on the trigger.

The little girl is frozen in fear.

Voss doesn't move for a few seconds. He then turns on the safety and holsters his gun.

He then reaches into his pocket and grabs a fistful of coins, throwing them in front of the little girl.

"Go buy yourself a dinner or something... And never return here."

The girl starts quickly grabbing the coins from the ground and shoving them to her pockets. She then starts
backing away from Voss, towards the exit gate.

Voss then takes out his handgun and fires into the air. The girl starts running.

He then returns inside.

...

On the inside, Voss shouts some orders at the soldiers. He then asks one grunt how is the blood bag supply.
The man replies they are barely meeting the needed amount.

Voss then goes into the room Endell is in.

"I am sorry for the delay... Mr. Gildner. Now where were we. So, Like I said your brother... was an inspiration.
Unfortunately, I am no scientist. So I had to do some less savory experiments."

Endell watches him in contempt, secretly trying to put as much power on the binding on his arm to see if he can
break it. Voss pats his blood bag.

"Eventually,  we found out that blood really is the most miraculous liquid."

Voss turns around.

"You just need a transfusion... from a good source."

Endell feels like his arm restraint has loosened a bit. Maybe he can break free.

Another grunt runs into the room.

"Sir, something's happening. There are some black guys all over the place. A lot of gunfire sir. They seem to be
forcing everyone in, and they are going after the heavily Modified."

"Interesting... news."

.

.

.

Elsewhere, several hours later.

Nella and Zora are still at the bistro. It took some work, but Nella managed to put together a radio,
using the bistro's antenna. She then recorded a message on er saying where they are and if anyone can hear them,
connected her phone's headphone jack to the radio and started broadcasting the message on repeat.
If she doesn't do anything else with it, she has some three days of broadcast.

Meanwhile, Zora a bit drunk. She has consumed much more than Nella.

Nella only took a small swig and then gave up on it - she doesn't drink and this was just a crutch
for not smoking.

"You know, I think you've had enough," Nella says, snatching the bottle from Zora.

"But..." Zora tries to disagree. Nella gives a very stern look that makes Zora rethink her defiance.

Nella throws out the bottle and the pack of cigarettes with it. This was a tough decision.

Zora then said in a very soft voice: "Ummm, I need to pee..."

"And what about it?"

"I kinda need your help to get to the toilet."

Nella sighed, but she knew she couldn't really say no. After all, she forgot Zora's crutches outside.
Right now, she could still hear some commotion, so she didn't feel like trying to get the crutches back.

Nella went over to Zora and said: "Alright, come, hold on, put your hand over my shoulder... and up we go!"

The two of them were now on their three working feet. Nella managed to help Zora with getting through the
bathroom. At first, it was some stumbling around before the two women found a way to walk together.

They reached a toilet and Nella helped Zora plop down onto it. She then stepped outside while Zora did
the deed. Nella felt like she was a mom potty training a toddler. She was a bit on edge.

"Hey, can you help me back up?"

"Sure."

And so the two ladies stumbled back to where they were.

There was silence for a while, until Zora spoke.

"Thanks a lot, I really appreciate it."

"It's fine."

...

"You know, I really wanted to dance. But it's like so... I am not very smart sometimes. And I couldn't
for the longest time. And so I went here and because of me, you are in trouble too. I'm really sorry.
I am just so... I don't know... I couldn't do anything or go anywhere for so long. And I feel like
inexperienced, clueless, if you get me? Bedridden most of my life, just watching things go by. And now,
everyone I talk to calls me an innocent ill girl and tries to protect me from everything... But I want to
live, to experience stuff..."

"Well, for dangerous stuff, you have come to the right place, Zora," Nella says with a sarcastic tone,
but the sarcasm starts to turn into melancholy, as she looks on the ground and memories start flooding
her mind.

"I get it. I used to have a similar problem. Couldn't walk, not before I got these legs. And I am a dance
teacher. When my legs weren't working, I couldn't dance either. It is worth it."

"Oh... how did it happen, were you born with bad legs like I was?"

"No, no. It was an... accident. For the longest time, I couldn't admit that it was. And I kept blaming
everyone, doing all sorts of irresponsible and bad things... There was this girl involved in the accident.
For a long time, I kept blaming her because I needed someone to blame... someone to be a target of my misery.
But now, I feel ashamed..."

"Ah, I'm sorry..."

"It's fine..."

...

"When this is over, can you teach me how to dance?"

"Sure." Zora was older than her students, but she felt some sympathy for her.

Nella then continued: "Alright, wait for a moment."

She then went upstairs and started going through the rooms where Neiro, Jay and others used to stay
back then.

Sadly, they couldn't stay upstairs for the night. There are some holes so the upstairs is much colder.

Most things were burned or at least a bit charred. She managed to find two blankets that were in a good
enough shape.

In another room, there was a carpet rolled up. It is no sleeping mat, but it will do in a pinch.
Downstairs, in the laundry room, there were two pillows, probably unwashed. Nella hoped that whatever
bodily dirt was on them has withered away with time.

One of the pillows smelled reasonably fine, the other had a mild cigarette stench to it.

She returned to Zora and unrolled the carpet.

"Crawl onto it. I don't think there is anything we can do now. Hopefully in the morning."

She then threw Zora a blanket and the cleaner pillow and kept the one that had a cigarette scent.

"Okay, thanks...," Zora said and burped.

"Don't you dare throwing up in the night. It's your fault you are stupid and drink like that"

"Sorry."

"Also, this carpet isn't big, so we need to stay close together. No other way, sorry."

They got ready to go to sleep.

"Good night," uttered Zora.

"Night."

"Also your hair is pretty nice. I think you should let it grow like an inch or two longer."

"Uh... thanks?"

.

.

.

Meanwhile, in the industrial zone.

Horus: "So pretty much all of my scars are from the military. Some of the cuts are from when I was a child,
they now look much bigger because I was tiny back then, it's not so bad, haha. As for the arm, there was a guy,
we fought, I won, got my hand burned. That's when I quit."

"Oh, I see," Neiro responded, "... must have been tough..."

"You get used to it... some things stay with you forever. You just have to come to terms with them
integrate them, so to speak. Light bulbs are much more fun than combat, haha."

Horus was done with his shoulder adjustment and Neiro was done with the bag of chips. She had a slight
feeling like she might get sick in the morning, but hopefully, it will be fine.

"What do we do next?" she asked.

"Next we sleep, it's better to wait for the morning, so we know what's what."

He then takes out his Colt SAA, cocks the hammer halfway and opens the gate. He then reaches into
his pocket and pulls out a few rounds and starts to insert them into the cylinder one by one, turning
it each time until the cylinder is fully loaded.

Loading six shots into a single-action revolver is generally considered bad optics if you are in a lot of
action, since if something hits the hammer from the back, then the gun might discharge, and if you have it
holstered on your belt, the discharge will likely be into your own leg. Horus however figured
that it is better to have more rounds in, since they only stagger the black soldiers anyway.

"There is a more pressing question," Horus looked up from his revolver, "what the hell did you do
to these two? What was up with you and their eyes?"

"Well... I have a kind of power. They call us Winged Ones. It's a type of Modified humans."

"Modified humans?"

"Yea, they are people with some abilities, which make them physically stronger and make them heal faster."

"You look like a short girl, not some muscular marvel."

"I. AM. NOT. SHORT."

"Oh, alright, suuure."

Neiro frowned at Horus, but then continued explain: "Winged ones don't have those abilities. But they can synchronize
and control other Modified."

"So that's what you did? Were the soldiers Modified?"

"It felt like it, but it was weird. I wanted to control them, but as soon as I attempted it, they just
did that thing and walked away. It felt off. After each of them, I felt tired."

"Ooh, I see. That's strange, never heard of anything like that. So maybe you can disable them, hmmm."

"I don't know."

"Well, only one way to find out, come."

Horus left the truck and Neiro reluctantly followed him. Once out of the truck, Horus picked up a stone from
the ground.

He put the stone in his pocket, took out his SAA, crouched, beckoned Neiro to crouch as well and
grabbed her by the elbow.

Slowly and carefully, they made their way towards the edge of the industrial zone.

There was one soldier standing nearby, a perfect target. The two of them hid behind the corner.

Horus threw the stone and got his gun ready, just in case.

The soldier went over to investigate. He kept getting closer and closer to them.

Twenty meters. Ten meters. Five meters. "Neiro now!"

The soldier turned over to them and started to ready his weapon, but Neiro used her power and tried to control him.
Once again, the soldier dropped his weapon and started walking away. A very faint blue glow could be from
beneath his mask. Neiro spotted it.

"Alright, that confirms it. How do you feel?" Horus said as they made their way back to the truck.

"It makes me tired. I could only do a few more..."

"Okay, so there is a limit, hmm."

They reached the truck, and went inside.

Neiro yawned.

"I think it is about time we go to sleep. Now, I stay here in the container, you take the travel bed
in the cabin. It is kinda cramped, but if I can fit there, you can fit there definitely. I stay here,
I should have a sleeping back in here somewhere. And this Loki guy... I think he is good where he is."

Loki now looked slightly less pale and sweaty.

And so everyone went to sleep.

...

Morning.

Horus wakes up, sticks his head out of the container and sees that it's dark. Very strange.
He goes back to check the first clock he can find in the truck, since it wasn't unusual for him
to wake up in the middle of the night. He didn't sleep particularly well, sometimes he had nightmares
about his previous life, but they were getting better the last few years.

Not this time, though. And waking up felt kind of difficult actually. During their talk on the train,
Neiro mentioned that people have trouble sleeping in The City, this was the opposite.

He checked one watch from a shelf and it said "10:07 AM". This is strange, maybe it's not set properly.
It didn't look like the sun was about to rise at all.

He went on to check two more clocks and his phone. All of them said the same.

"Something's off," he thought.

It was time to wake up Neiro. Loki looked much better, but apparently, he had a happy little accident
into the bucket during the night. Horus kindly went to empty it to a sewer nearby.

.

Neiro was sleeping peacefully in the truck's cabin. The bed in the cabin was high up, not even a meter
under the ceiling.

She can hear someone saying "Hey, wake up. Wake up, something's off."
Neiro was confused and dazed and just had a good time sleeping, so she didn't make any effort to wake up
and just rolled over.

"Hey, wake up. Neiro." No response.

A hand slams the steering wheel of the truck. It honks loudly. Neiro is shocked and quickly springs up,
hitting her head on the ceiling and plummeting back down to the bed.

"Wake up, I said."

"Alright, what's going on? It's still night, can't you see?!" Neiro said in a very cranky, angry and hurt tone.

"Well, that's the issue. It's not. Look at my watch. It's half past ten," Horus said showing Neiro a pocket watch.
It was a little close for her eye, so she backed of a few inches before she could read it.

"Oh, what the hell?"

"No idea. It's as if time stood still. However, it has gotten a few degrees warmer. Let's go check out the warehouse.
Also, I got a few light bulbs to mount," Horus says, revealing a few packaged light bulbs.

"These have a timer in them and shift color according to the time of the day. So during the day, they have
a higher color temperature, so they are more white or blue. During the evening and the night, they shift over
to lower color temperatures and become yellow to orange. One needs to protect their circadian rhythm, right?"

After Neiro got ready, they broke into the warehouse. It was a golden mine. It was apparently a supply
warehouse for some sort of convenience store. There were some cans, basic appliances and tools,
and also things one might find in a hardware store. There was some other food in it as well, but most of it
was definitely spoiled. The warehouse hasn't been touched in years.

Horus took some stuff from the hardware section and set it aside, then dragged over some furniture boxes.
This was no quality furniture, only basic stuff that is seasonally sold in supermarkets, but it will
do in a time of need.

With Neiro's help, they made some space.

"I think we will be camping here for some time now, until we figure out what's going on," he said.

Neiro looked over at him and nodded, but didn't know what to say.

"I am worried about Endell," she spontaneously blurted out a while later.

"I get it, but in the current situation... I think everyone's plans are on hold. Even the terrorists.
But yes, we will go for him as soon as possible. I am devising a sort of plan as we speak."

Neiro wanted to ask about the plan, when a third voice suddenly interrupted them.

"Hello?"

Both Neiro and Horus turned around. It was Loki, he woke up and went into the warehouse.

"Howdy, how are you feeling?" Horus asked. Neiro was still a bit surprised to see the guy walking around.

"Like shit maaan. I don't remember... shit. Ye, like nada, bro."

"Hard message to decipher. You want anything to eat?"

"Maybe later maan. You got a smoke?" Loki asked.

"No," said Horus.

"Yea," said Neiro, taking a pack of cigarettes out of her pocket and opening it, so Loki can take one.

Loki went over to Neiro and snatched the whole pack. "Thanks, sis. You single btw?"

Neiro frowned and took a deep breath: "NO."

"Alright, chill, no disrespect, sis, ye?"

"Do you remember anything at all?" Horus asked him.

"No, nada. Blank slate bro."

"What about Loki?" Neiro asked.

"Oooh, yeaaa, I remember that. It may be my name? I think."

"Well we are calling you Loki from now on. The City went to shit while you were out. We are hiding from
an army of strange immortal soldiers."

"Cool man, that's intense, broo. So you are saying going for a walk would be a bad idea?"

"Yea, don't do anything stupid."

"Got it, chief. Maybe a little one, got it."

Neiro was amazed at seeing someone who was more annoying that what certain annoyed people told her about herself.

"By the way, big guy, why do you want to build an antenna, man?" Loki said, pointing at the pile Horus set aside.

"My name is Horus, with a -U-S. How did you know?"

"I don't know, I kinda did, maan. Also, Horus, you look like a cool guy, do you mind if I call you the big man boss
chief."

"Mildly."

"Sis, what's your name. And what happened to your eye? Whyyy are you that short, jeez," Loki exclaimed laughing a little.
Perhaps not everything was out of his system.

Neiro's internal temperature was rising.

"I'm Neiro. I AM NOT SHORT, AND THE EYE IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. Also, you are the one short," Neiro said, letting off
steam through her nose. Admittedly, Loki had only about 170cm and was a bit scrawny guy in build as well.

"Okayyy, chill, sis. No disrespect," at this point, he already had a cigarette in his mouth. He had a lighter in his pocket.
This was seemingly his only possession.

He bent his back backwards in an effort to stretch it and was about to say something, but as he did, gravity worked against him,
the cigarette fell in his mouth and Loki started choking and coughing.

Two seconds later, he spat a very slimy cigarette on the ground and said: "Ouch, hot, the hell."

"These things suck, and they kill you. It's not even that good," Horus reacted.

"Well, cool thing old man, but what bout that? I do what I do, broo"

"I have something better."

"Jeez, man, you got weed? Should have said straight, now we're talkin maan."

"No, I don't. I have cigars."

"Keep em, chief," Loki half-mouthed as he lit another cigarette, "unless there is weed in them."

Neiro however demandingly extended her hand to Horus. Horus rolled his eyes, took out a fresh cigar, lit it, pulled in, breathed out
and handed it over to her.

"Hell, is everyone in The City a junkie?"

"Yea," Neiro said with a toothy smile. Between her teeth was a cigar, a scene reminiscent from mafia bosses of old,
except now in significantly cuter and shorter package.

She smoked it silently for a few moments, then asked: "So what do we do now?"

"Well, we have some basic amenities set up here in the warehouse. Looks like there is toilet and a bathroom as well. Dirty, but working,
we can clean them later. Loki will do it, right?" Horus said with a smug smile, "First, we need to establish communications, there might
be people willing to help us in these dire conditions. And if cell phones are down, the next medium will be radio. So I will need you
to sneak to the very very edge of the industrial zone and plant an antenna on top of one of the buildings there. We saw it yesterday."

"I don't want to do anything like that, why can't you?"

"I will accompany you most of the way, but you have the ability to sneak past those guys, you can 'turn them off', and you are the most
'compact' of us. Best for sneaking around. Now, the soldiers seem kinda dumb from what I have witnessed, so it will be fine if you
just lay down the antenna cable as you go."

Horus then took Loki aside and together, they modified a climbing harness Horus had and prepared an antenna, splitting it
into three pieces that could be screwed in by hand.

Afterwards, Horus went into the truck and retrieved a pair of walkie-talkies.

"These are a novelty, they have a pretty big range, should cover all the way to the river... maybe.
Here, put on this harness. We have modified it so you can take stuff with you."

Neiro reluctantly put the thing on. The way it was modified allowed for attacking things to the back, like a backpack,
and also for attaching something to the hips. She didn't pay much attention, she was thinking about Val. He must be out there,
alone. She was worried about him too.

"Alright, I've made it so that things can be attached to your hips. No disrespect, really, but you do not have the upper body
strength for attaching cargo to the side of your shoulders, but you ran pretty good! So hips are a much better options. To the right,
we'll put this spool of wire. You will just let it unroll itself. It's a good idea to keep it very loose, so that a moving
cable doesn't arouse suspicions. On your back we will put the three antenna rods."

"Okay, but that sounds scary. Is there really no one else who can do it?" Neiro still wasn't really onboard with the plan.

"Well maybe this yes, but you are the only one who can disable those guys. You may be the only hope for venturing further into
the city. Unless there is more of you Winged Ones."

"Valentine is a Winged One! We should go rescue him," Neiro lit up.

"Great idea, but first, we need to be able to communicate."

Neiro now understood that this is only a hurdle on her way to save Endell and Valentine, and she was determined to do something.

"Loki, get your dirty feet of the sofa, we just assembled it with Neiro."

"A'ight, sorry chief, jeez."

Horus then threw Neiro a walkie-talkie.

"You press this button and you talk to me, got it? Attach it to the clip on your chest."

He then took out a plushie toy which had a clip as well. It was some black cubical character with purple eyes
and no other facial features.

"Hey, this tiny guy is a good luck charm. Take it with you for protection. Attach it to the other clip on your chest."

Neiro didn't believe it was a good luck charm, but she thought the plushie was cute, so she took him anyway.

Ready to go then. Meanwhile, Loki disappeared from the warehouse and ventured off somewhere into the industrial zone.

.

.

.

A black soldier notices movement. They mostly paid attention only to what was in the same level as them, not noticing things up.

It was like a corner of the eye action. Since he was a standard Sentinel, he went over there to investigate.

Huh, there is nothing there.

He turns around and suddenly an arrow penetrates his head and throws him to the ground. He starts to get up, when something
jumps down and stomps on him, pinning him to the ground.

The something is a man in classic samurai gear, although the armor looks more fancy and more durable than what is commonly shown.

He rips the arrow out of the squirming soldier's head and proclaims: "悪魔です".

Meanwhile, Valentine is in his flat alone and worried. He clutches his dagger. He made several attempts to call someone, but they
all failed - no reception.

Whereas Minerva took a very different approach. She kept throwing explosives at the soldiers for a while, but when she realized
that it doesn't help or kill them, she just went inside and opened a bottle of wine. She tried calling as well, but again,
to no avail. She was a bit concerned and her feelings about what's happening and happened were still all over the place.

# EPISODE 1: FIRA

> There are not many persons who know what wonders are opened to them in the
stories and visions of their youth; for when as children we learn and dream,
we think but half-formed thoughts, and when as men we try to remember,
we are dulled and prosaic with the poison of life. But some of us awake in
the night with strange phantasms of enchanted hills and gardens, of fountains
that sing in the sun, of golden cliffs overhanging murmuring seas, of plains
that stretch down to sleeping cities of bronze and stone, and of shadowy companies of heroes
that ride caparisoned white horses along the edges of thick forests; and then we know
that we have looked back through the ivory gates into that world of wonder which
was ours before we were wise and unhappy.

There is no light. A realm completely in the dark. Nothing to touch, nothing to orient yourself
in the space you are in. No up or down, just the direction of the fall.

How long is the fall? Minutes, hours, days? Is there a meaning to time if there is nothing to show
for it?

Who is falling? Fira. Or at least she thinks she is falling. Maybe this is all just a dream.

This eternal fall down the Abyss brings out the peace in man. It is a fall, but there is no landing.
It is motion, but there is nothing it could be relative to. It is like being suspended in space. Motion
loses its meaning.

Where is fire and light, shadows twist and turn. But in this abyss, there are shadows none.

Yet, Fira's fall is not eternal. She is not frozen in time or anywhere else.

But it takes hours, maybe days. Or so does it feel. Could be seconds.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>STARRING</b></div>

No images from the outside, a deprived mind. Begets images from the outside. Visions flood
the sight. Of what? She does not know. They are blurry and inexact, like vapor - try to touch
it and it twists and disappears.

> That is not dead which can eternal lie,
And with strange aeons even death may die.

Fira opened her eyes. The wind from her fall was running through her hair. She was naked and she had
nothing. And yet, she didn't feel alarmed. Just apathethic, lethargic. She barely even moved her eyes
to try if she can see something, but there was nothing. Only the Void.

Her whole body was relaxed and apart from the visions of incomprehensible memories,
her mind was relaxed as well.

It felt like she was falling for hours, or days. Maybe it was just a feeling. Maybe it was
all just a dream.

She turned around, now she was falling with her head up, looking into where skies would usually be,
but there was seemingly nothing in this uniform realm of darkness.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>FIRA</b> AS THE EMISSARY</div>

> Through the ghoul-guarded gateways of slumber,<br>
Past the wan-mooned abysses of night,<br>
I have lived o'er my lives without number,<br>
I have sounded all things with my sight;<br>
And I struggle and shriek ere the daybreak, being driven to madness with fright.

A spark of consciousness appears within Fira. A part of her activates and beckons her to start releasing herself
from the chains of lethargy.

A tiny flame appears in her eyes, eyes which looked lifeless before. It is the flame of life.

Bit of herself regained, Fira turns around once again, her eye wide open.

She can see something tiny. Like a tiny sprite, fluttering around in the darkness far below.

It is white, with a hint of blue, it shimmers ever so slightly. Something about it brings tears to Fira's eyes.
Only slightly, like a fleeting memory of a nice moment ages ago.

It is a star. Bright, like Polaris, up above - or down below - like Polaris. A single eye looking into the vast darkness
of this cosm.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>ZETTAI RYOIKI</b> AS THE SAMURAI</div>

The star becomes brighter. But only a tiny bit. It was as if Fira was approaching it, but it was still miles away.

> Looking up at the stars, I know quite well<br>
That, for all they care, I can go to hell,<br>
But on earth indifference is the least<br>
We have to dread from man or beast.<br>
<br>
How should we like it were stars to burn<br>
With a passion for us, we could not return?<br>
If equal affection cannot be,<br>
Let the more loving one be me.

It shimmers, and it feels like a friendly wink. Heart-warming, even. But how could such emotions be elicited by a star?
A colossal giant of gas, floating around in the vast emptiness, only burning fuel, and churning. Could they ever feel?
These eternal eyes in the night.

Fira feels like she is closer to it, but it is still very far.

Until now, she has been cold, but she didn't seem to feel it. Now, she realised it, she can feel the cold,
but also, a tiny hint of warmth emanating from the star. It is a pleasant warmth. Like a warm wind on a summer day.

Fira puts her hand forward, obscuring the star. She turns her hand around and looks at it. She looks at her arm.
And her other arm. Her torso, her chest, her stomach. Finally her legs and feet.

This is her.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>NEIRO</b> AS THE INFILTRATOR</div>

> The dragons shall never be forgotten…<br>
We knights fought valiantly, but for every one of them, we lost three score of our own.<br>
Exhilaration, pride, hatred, rage… The dragons teased out our dearest emotions.<br>
…Thou will understand, one day.<br>
At thy twilight, old thoughts return, in great waves of nostalgia.

Fira once again extended her hand, trying to grab the start and hold it in her palm, but to no avail.

She felt like something was changing, though. Like a build up of something inside her, maybe outside. Maybe in the dream.
If it was a dream.

The star shone even brighter. The blue hints were stronger. At first, it appeared like there was only a single shade
of blue, but the proximity revealed many more.

The star shimmered. It winked again. There was something so beckoning about it. A deep sense of longing, yearning. Maybe
for something that was once there and was lost, maybe a sense of longing for something that could have been there, or something
that might be there in the future.

The star did not speak and yet it felt like it promised all of former. Who does not once in a while lament a missed opportunity,
or wish for what was, what could have been?

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>HORUS</b> AS THE OPERATOR</div>

It was quite warm now. Everything was. Like late spring or an early summer.

There was a scent of sea salt in the air.

The build-up reached its climax. Fira felt like she broke through some barrier. The star shone brighter and brighter.

Now, it was almost blinding light. She had to cover her eyes with her hand to protect herself from the light.

Then, there was sound. It was like the sound of ice breaking, but everywhere.

The light was very bright for a moment, then it started to return to a sunny day's light.

Fira opened her eyes. She was still falling, but below her was the sea. A tiny island with a lighthouse far away underneath her.
Above her - a clear blue sky.

There was the undeniable smell of sea in the air. The waves seemed calm, but she was still too far away.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>JAKE</b> AS THE BUILDER</div>

Fira was plummeting very fast towards the see surface, naked and defenseless against the monumental element that is the ocean.

She could see there was a man standing on the shore of that tiny island. He was too far away for her to see who he was
or what he looked like.

Unexpectedly, she started to slow down. She was falling right in front of the man, a few feet in front of him into the water.

She slowed down further, and further.

The man went forward to the very edge of the water.

Fira slowed down even further. She was now like a feather falling down.

The man steps onto the surface of the water. It is strange. Around the place he stands, waves are going the other direction.
Instead of waves crashing into the island's shore, it appears as if they were collecting from the shore and radiating outwards.

Further ahead is a belt where there no waves at all, it's where the positive and the negative waves meet and cancel each other.
In this small belt, maybe only five feet across, it feels like time has stopped.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right">AND</div>

The man looks quite old. His hair and beard are completely gray, with hints of pure white, but his eyes are very clear and have a light blue
color. Lighter than what is commonly seen in men. Lighter than those of Neiro and Valentine, but blue nevertheless.

He is wearing a simple, if not antiquated, outfit made from loose leather. He is wearing a darker leather hat, one common for
fishermen and whalers of old.

In his hand he is holding a long stick. At the top, there is a few order leaves. Interestingly, the stick looks younger and greener
at the bottom than at the top. The top part is stern and matured, whereas the base of the branch appears to be green, young,
and malleable.

He puts his stick aside and walks over to Fira, whose falling motion has all but stopped by now. He has a peaceful,
friendly expression on his face. And yet, there is a hint of loneliness in his eyes. And purity.

He extends his hands towards Fira's face, and holds her head in his hands, stroking her gently.

"Oh, there you are, I've been waiting... You are just a little one, ah, the horrors. I am sorry, child," the man said with
a very gentle, but old voice.

His hands were soft and felt young. But just as the entirety of the old man, they radiated a feeling of ancientry. Of eons gone
by, and times perhaps even before the world was the world. Eons into the future after all that is known will cease and there will
be a new unknown to uncover in the universe.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>VALENTINE</b> AS THE FRIEND</div>

"Ah, the horrors... But, I am glad to see you, child. May you be safe. May you find reprieve and peace, even if only for
a while. Child from above, from the stars."

"Good luck, little one," the man continued, gently stroking Fira. For some reason, she couldn't react with anything but her
expressions. Like when she first saw the star, she once again felt the feeling of almost crying of happiness and peace of mind.

The man looked into her eyes, and she looked into his. She felt like she could see the entirety of the ocean in the mans eyes,
Of the surface, the reefs, even the depths below. Everything, but timeless, large and majestic, cosmic.

The man now only extended his left hand towards Fira, gently grabbing her chin and softly envelopping the lower part of her
face with his hand. His thumb landed on her right cheek and when it touched, a flower started appearing on her skin. It was a simplistic
design, a black tattoo seemingly growing from beneath the man's finger.

It was the Star of Betlehem, a gentle flower.

The man stepped two steps forward, so he was to Fira's side. Fira descended and he caught her into his hands, the lowered her onto the
now still water. Fira let him, there was not a single bone in her body that had any desire to fight back or felt endangered.

"Farewell, child. Mayest thou thy peace discover." As the man spoke these words, Fira started floating away.

She started feeling very sleepy. In a few moments, she closed her eyes, and her mind floated away too.

.

.

.

Fira woke up by virtue of being in flight at a high speed. Something launched her out of the water and she was flying above
the beach straight towards the forest.

She crashed into the forest, slamming her head into the tree. This knocked her unconscious.

Fira woke up about an hour later. Her head hurt like hell and she was bleeding out of her forehead. She had trouble
remembering what is what and organizing her thoughts.

She got back up to her feet and realized she is in a small forest near the coast of what appeared like an island.
From here, she couldn't see if it was island or a continent, though.

She is very confused and probably has a concussion. With difficulty, she stumbles out of the forest and onto the beach.

Fira has no idea where to go, so she just stumbles along the beach until she sees something.

Soon, she can see some people at the beach. There is a pier and a small fishing boat is docked next to it.

Fira stumbles forward.

The people notice her and an older motherly lady starts running towards her, when she sees the state in which Fira is.

"Oh my, girl, what happened to ye?" the old lady yells from far away.

Fira tries to speak but it takes a few seconds until she organizes a sentence in her head: "I... hit my head on a tree?"

"Poor girl," the woman laments as she hurries over to Fira.

But when she does, she is awe-struck, and proclaims: "Oh my, you must be... You must be the emissary! As it was foretold!
Oh my god. Bless Xexanoth for letting us be the ones who discover you."

The woman takes Fira hand puts it over her shoulder and grabs Fira's waist from the other side to help her walk.

She calls over to who seems to be her husband: "Richter, come here. We found the emissary, we have to help her and
get her to Yiandh!"

Fira, probably from the concussion starts feeling sick and asks the woman to stop. She then vomits onto the sand.
The vomit has the color and viscosity of tar, and it looks like there is an oyster in the vomit. Fira feels very week.

Richter, who looks to be around fifty, just like the woman, is however already at Fira's side and he takes her into his
arms, lifting her off the ground and carrying her to their carriage.

Fira loses consciousness.

.

.

.

Fira wakes up some time later. Her head is still a mess, but she feels a bit better. She is lying in the carriage,
covered with a rudimentary blanket. Next to her is the woman. She put some healing herbs on Fira's forehead and she
is giving her a cold compress.

"Ah, little one, you are finally awake, I was worried," says the woman in a motherly tone.

"I am Rodina, how are you feeling? Is your name Fira?"

Fira looks confused for a moment, then aswers: "I am feeling sick... But it's better... I am Fira, how did you..."

"Hush, Fira, don't speak, you need to rest. I will explain," the woman says kindly.

"You are the prophesized emissary of our god, Xexanoth. You must be her, you look just like her. Our god has
revealed you to us through dreams. We are supposed to care for you. We are bringing you to Yiandh, the capital
city of The Island. We are humbled that you appeared to us, but we fear we must be insufficient for an
emissary of gods such as yourself... The high priests will provide you with whatever you need, our lady..."
the woman says in a humble tone.

"What... thanks..." Fira responds and goes back to sleep.

.

.

.

Fira woke up again at the boundary of the city. Their carriage was given priority when Richter explained who they are
carrying.

Through a hole in the cloth she could see some hints of the city. It was very clean and pristine looking, the people
there looked medieval in appearance, but clean and civilized, the road was made of bricks, but it was high quality,
not too rough.

The carriage stopped in front of a large temple.

A priest came outside and conversed with Richter and Rodina for a moment. He then pulled out a bag of gold, kindly thanked
both of them and signaled over to some of other inhabitants of the large temple.

The priest then came over to Fira, who was still lying in the carriage. He stopped in front of Fira and said:
"Greetings, I'm the high priest at the Temple of Xexanoth, it is an honor to meet you, his emissary, _Fira ot Yogfm'll_.
The people will be with you shortly."

Fira was a little confused and said: "Xexanoth?"

"Yes, Xexanoth, our god. Xexanoth, the cosmic whale god. Xexanoth, who stands in opposition to Aforgomon, the god of time. Locked
in an eternal struggle over the flow of history. Xexanoth, the bane of time, our benevolent god," the high priest proclaimed with
fervor.

"He announced to us your advent, Fira ot Yogfm'll"

Fira was still very confused and unwell, in no condition to question the man or anything else. She decided to play
along and abide until she can do something.

Several priestesses come out of the temple and take her away. Inside, they treat her wounds better than Richter and Rodina
could, they wash her and they give her clean clothes, throwing away what she had on herself before. The hot water
makes Fira feel much better.

Then, they brought food and beverages in front of her and once Fira drank something and felt well fed, they introduced
her to her chambers, a very nice suite in the Temple of Xexanoth.

There was a painting of her in ornamental clothes in the room. Odd.

Fira laid in bed until the night. However, there was a hint of mistrust in her, something felt off, she didn't know what.
She still couldn't remember much, but there were some disembodied flashes. She remembered how to do some things.

And so she decided that the temple is not a place where she would want to be. She found a bag in her room and stuffed
it with basic items and some food. Then she put on warmer clothing.

Finally, she took out a decorative rope that was around the largest window.

During the dark of the night, when only the moon beamed and Yiandh was almost completely asleep, she snuck out of her window
and ran along the roof of the temple's lower floor.

She could see the entirety of the city and a big portion of the island as well from here. Fira made her plan.

She tied the rope around one of the gargoyles that was on the temple and proceeded to stealthily scale down the building.

However, the rope was about two meters too short. She had to jump.

Fira climbed as down as she could, until she only had the very end of the rope in her hands. Now it was not that much
of a drop, but it would be a loud landing.

And so she did, there was a loud bang and one of the priestesses ran to the window, spotting Fira. Fira
went on the run and within half an hour, she snuck out of the city.

Fira is frantically running towards another forest which is nearby the city.

She manages to make it into the forest, she slows down, it doesn't look like there is anyone in pursuit.

Fira stumbles around in the forest for some time. It is much denser and darker than the first one.

Eventually, she spots a cottage in the forest. There is still light inside and smoke is coming out of the chimney.

Fira approaches it and knocks on the door. A very old woman opens the door.

"Hello, young lady, what brings you here? I am just an old handmaiden, long retired. Wait, aren't you the emissary, child?"
The old woman wasn't sure, since she couldn't see that well anymore.

"Yes, but please, I need somewhere to stay. Can you help me?" Fira said with a pleading expression and a sense of urgency
in her voice.

"Alright, come in. I can let you sleep here. I don't have much, I am just an old woman, but I will share what little I have."

"Thank you," Fira is relieved.

.

.

.

Meanwhile a young-looking man in light armor mounts a horse under the stairs leading to the Temple of Xexanoth. The high
priest stands in front of him.

"Chosen paladin Rhatholei, fulfill your solemn duty and stand true to your vows. Go, and find the emissary. Find her,
protect her from danger and bring her here. Now go, godspeed, good knight."

"Blessings of Xexanoth," Rhatholei responds and rides off on his horse.

.

.

.

Elsewhere, in a different world.

A samurai-looking fellow is giving the business to a group of black soldiers. He penetrated each of them with a handful
of arrows, and he is presently cutting them with his daisho, that is, his katana and wakizashi pair. However, the soldiers keep
rising back up, no matter what wounds he inflicts.

A blue butterfly with wings that have a black edge flies in front of him. He spots it through the corner of his eye.

The soldiers are firing at him, but the rubber bullets keep bouncing off his armor and have little to no effect.

Suddenly, several of the soldiers lose interest and wander elsewhere. He temporarily knocks off the rest with his naginata
and climbs the nearest building to see what is going on.

The soldiers captured and are dragging away some man. He looks to be mutated. He is suffering heavily from the side-effects of
Modification, but the samurai does not know that. He is not from around here.

But he decides he will not let them take him away.

He fires several arrows into the soldiers who are holding him and descends the building very quickly.
He starts cutting into them with his polearm and manages to free the man, dragging him away to a side alley.

"You alright," the samurai asks with a heavy asian, probably Japanese, accent.

"Yes... what the hell man, let go off me."

The Modified then runs away from the samurai.

The samurai is disappointed, but no matter. He feels like it is time to retrieve his arrows from the soldiers before they get too
far, and so he goes after them.

While he does that, something can be said about his looks. He has very dark brown eyes and long black spiky hair reaching to a inches
below his shoulders. He was fair skinned and fairly muscular, but more on the athletic side. He is about 178 centimeters tall,
and he looks under thirty.

Meanwhile, he has already retrieved his arrows. He climbs the nearest building and lies in wait.
