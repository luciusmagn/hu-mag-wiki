> As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.

Turn the key, the engine kicks in and starts to whir. One last checkpoint before the destination.

Step on clutch, shift gears.

The massive armored truck starts to move. It's a heavy, colossal machine.
If you drive only a small car, then tough luck, you don't stand a chance against this monster.

Step on clutch, shift gears.

Trucks like these have many more gears than regular cars. It helps when going uphill, or when
the cargo is heavy.

The driver adjusts the revue mirror. One should only do this before the vehicle starts to move,
but there is no one and the truck isn't moving that fast yet.

The exit gate opens, the way is clear.

Step on clutch, shift gears. Repeat.

There is a small astronaut hanging from the rear view mirror. The symbol of man's greatest ambition.
Its head is comically large.

> You're going to pay a price for every bloody thing you do
and everything you don't do. You don't get to choose to not
pay a price. You get to choose which poison you're
going to take. That's it.

As he drives, the man can't help but notice the slowly deteriorating quality of the road. The asphalt is faded,
cracked and there is the occasional pothole here and there.

Step on clutch, shift gears.

The road is completely empty, he can let loose a bit. Let's see if this tank can still go as fast as he remembers it.

It's winter, but there is no snow on the road, luckily. Or anywhere around, for that matter. In this region,
the winter has been particularly dry.

The road is less asphalt more earth now and so the twenty wheels start to leave a trail of dust and dirt.
From the behind, it might look like the aftermath of a sandstorm.

Step on clutch, shift gears. Foot slips, the transmission lets out an agonizing scream. The foot isn't as
sensitive and dependable as it used to be years ago.

The man turns on the radio. Right now, they are playing "Short Change Hero" by "The Heavy". It's a pretty nice song.

It speaks about running away from problems, a place ill-suited for a hero
and the perspective of the eponymous "short change hero". That is, an outcast and who possesses undesirable or unethical qualities,
but, despite that, tries to be the hero during difficult times and events, out of compassion or honor.

Step on clutch, shift gears.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>HORUS</b> AS THE LIGHT BULB SALESMAN</div>

Love is the desire to see unnecessary suffering ameliorated<br>
Truth is the handmaiden of love<br>

The tachometer is approaching 80 miles per hour. This is slightly faster than what this road supports for this kind of vehicle.
The enormous cloud of dust is a testament to that.

Out of the truck, the driver notices that every now and then, ruins appear in the surroundings. They are all sorts of buildings.

Some are large, some are small. There is one that looks like a convenience store. That one could have been a gas station.

One cannot help but wonder what happened, that would cause such strange, oddly lonely, ruins to be all around the place.

Nature calls, it's time to stop for a moment.

Step on clutch, shift to neutral. Lightly step on break, slowly come to the stop. It feels like gliding and it almost
evokes the notion that perhaps, this iron beast, has a little finesse in it as well.

Exit the truck. It's surprisingly windy here. The driver couldn't tell from the truck,
there were no trees or other vegetation that would give it away. Ruins don't bend to the will of the wind.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>NEIRO</b> AS THE ACCIDENTAL GUIDE</div>

As all men know, relieving oneself in windy weather requires certain positioning. Wind from the back is optimal and increases effective firing range,
but any angle that is outward is fine.

The driver stepped off the road and over the ditch, as he didn't want to sully it. It's already bad as it is.

Unzip zipper, ready, fire. Soon enough, the bladder is at peace once more. It wasn't the only thing at peace though.
There was something solemn about this place, as ruined and barren as it was, and the man felt that.

He sullied these hallowed grounds with the remains of the fluid intake of days past, it would make sense to honor it with something more
palatable, he thought.

Open the right door of the truck and reach in to the shotgun seat's compartment. He pulls out a box of cigars.

Calling the passenger seat shotgun is quite a strange phenomenon. It used to be associated with carriages and the
idea of a gun-toting partner in a reckless mobile shootout in the old wild West, but it's faux. It was invented by Westerns, it's a fake.

The cigars are, much like most things in the truck, a novelty. They bear the logo of one old game and in seemingly golden letters,
there is a sentence etched into them: "Kept you waiting, huh?"

Lighter out, open, spark, ignite, partake.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>???</b> AS THE SHADOWY FIGURE</div>

These are not great for your lungs. The man was well aware. His lungs breathed in much worse before, though, he thought.
This should be the equivalent of a fresh smelling rose garden in contrast to the past.

Some things stay with you for the duration of your life. A fair number of them stays in the lungs.

It took a while to get into the right mood. The man was no smoker, it was an occasional endeavor at best. Something to take the
edge off, once in a while.

All around, it was silent. All one could hear was the muffled sound of the last bits of "Short Change Hero" coming from inside the truck.
It was peaceful, and lonely. Long ago has this place been claimed the kingdom of genius loci.

As he put out the cigar and stored it away in his trench coat's pocket, the man noticed something flying in the wind towards him.
At first, it looked like a bag, the kind made out of linen or some other fabric, but the shape didn't look quite right.

The man stepped a little to the side, so he was right in the path of the flying object, and just as it was passing by him, caught it with his hand.

It was an apron. The kind that baristas, or sometimes bartenders, wear. There was some writing on it in the corner, but it was hard to make out
over the scorch marks that were all over it. The first letter the man could distinguish to be K. A K-something, then.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>FIRA</b> AS THE RAT</div>

Must have been a fire. Quite some time ago, if it was from the ruins. If it was from one of the cities, most probably the destination one,
it would still have taken months if not years for the wind to carry it this far.

> "No tree can grow to Heaven,” adds the ever-terrifying Carl Gustav Jung,
psychoanalyst extraordinaire, “unless its roots reach down to Hell."

This apron is an odd encounter, thought the man. And it was the kind of oddity that attracted him. A fine addition to his collection.

He gently folded it up and went to the back of the truck.

Unlock, lift iron bar, pull door open. Turn the lights on.

Everything inside was in order. He was a little fearful that his shipment of light bulbs might have been damaged by the reckless driving,
but luckily, no such thing did happen. It's fragile cargo, yes, but if handled well, it will be fine even if a rocket hits the truck.

This container was much bigger than the ones that could have been commonly seen on cargo ships in the days of yore. It was about a meter wider
on each side, a meter and a half taller, and a meter longer than the standard dimensions.

This allowed for two floors to fit into the container, each of which was lined with shelves containing all sorts of things. It also provided
for quite comfortable living quarters when on the road.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>JAKE</b> AS THE PILOT</div>

After thinking for a moment, the man has found the perfect place for the apron and secured it with elastic rope. This, along with the fact
that the shelves were bolted to the interior walls of the container, ensured that nothing, that wasn't supposed to be moving, could move.

Close door, secure with iron bar, lock, pat the container as if to appreciate its good work. Time hit the road again.

> "Every bit of learning is a little death.
Every bit of new information challenges a previous
conception, forcing it to dissolve into chaos before
it can be reborn as something better."

Turn the key, the engine kicks in and starts to whir.

Step on clutch, shift gears. The beast starts to roll again. What a strange place this was.

He wonders if the way back will feel the same way, or if it will be "old news", at that point.

Step on clutch, shift gears.

Repeat.

The radio starts to only produce static, it seems like there is no broadcast the way he's headed.

No matter, there is still a lot of tapes and other media to play. The driver owns several a few boxes of just music.

Step on clutch, shift gears. Damn, all music is in the container. Staring at the road it is.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>&lt;MISSING&gt;</b> AS THE LADY OF THE RIVER</div>

Unfortunately, there is nothing interesting anymore.

Step on clutch, shift gears. Poke the astronaut. It swings from side to side.
It should now be only half an hour until the destination. Luckily, it doesn't seem like there will be a queue
at the entry gates.

Roll the window down a little, wind blows through hair and into the face. The man retrieves sunglasses from his glass compartment.
They are a novelty as well, of course. The temples of the specs are adorned on one side with a cracked skull and, on the other,
with a Rubik's cube.

An artist had them custom-made decades ago. The Rubik's cube is the representation of the infinity of problems, since there are thousands
times more configurations than grains of sand on Earth.

The cracked skull resembles the ancient supercontinent of Pangaea. It reminds of the last time
the entire world was truly connected and of the importance of connections.

> Loneliness does not come from having no people around you,
but from being unable to communicate the things that
seem important to you.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right">AND</div>

Step on clutch, shift gears.

The city finally shows up on the horizon. The walls are very tall and let off an oppressive atmosphere. Their monumentality
is a testament to the separating power they possess, of what needs to be kept out, or, more precisely, of what needs to be kept in.

Tiny hints of smoke can be seen over the walls. It's the houses trying to stay warm during the winter.

Finding a map of the city was a difficult endeavor, at best. One could only find rough ones, but the driver had a rough idea where he needs to go.
There is a parking lot for trucks next to the largely abandoned industrial area. And this was itself close to the entry gate.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>CPT. VOSS</b> AS ROCKET LAUNCHER</div>

Finally at the gates. There was no other vehicle waiting for entry or attempting to leave.

Shut the engine, remove key from ignition, poke the astronaut.

The man took his documents from the glove compartment. Details about his shipment and his newly assigned business permit.
The documents requested a three-day stay, excluding day of arrival and day of departure.

> One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light,
but by making the darkness conscious. The latter procedure, however,
is disagreeable and therefore not popular.

The man approaches the booth that governs the massive gate, behind which the city lights.

Freeze frame, stop.

Time to digress for a moment. I haven't properly introduced myself yet.

# INTERMEZZO: THE CARTOGRAPHER

I'm sorry for not admitting my existence earlier. I got completely absorbed in my attempt at story telling.

Very well, then.

Hello, I welcome you, dear listener. On this most auspicious of nights, let me recount a series of strange events that make a story,
one that I hope will be compelling, even if only a bit.

However, I must warn you - I'm a cartographer, not a writer or a storyteller, I work with maps and fact-sheets,
the telling of a story, despite being a newfound hobby of mine, still largely remains an enigma to me.
I cannot accurately convey the feelings, the oddities or the speech patterns of people I have never met in person.

I am still experimenting with some ways of dramatization and attempts to convey meaning and emotion, but for the most part, you,
dear listener, will have to read between the lines and infer the feelings and meanings yourself from context and the data I present.

Now, the data I'm privy to is very thorough and it records the events without a slightest hint of doubt, but it lacks life.
It's cold and hard and more suitable for a person like me, but not for a passionate listener, such as you are, undoubtedly.

Therefore, I try to withhold some information and present events in order which I hope might create a good story, with suspense
and meaning and flow. All that which you expect from a literary masterpiece, or a podcast or a movie.

So please, try to infer what's missing and extrapolate from presented data, and I wish you to get as much enjoyment out of this as I do.

This is a role-play of one strange cartographer, a man new to the waters of storytelling, so please, be gentle. In return, I will
try to make up for my imperfections with my virtues. I have got some items of interest prepared for later.

Alright, let's get back to it then. But first, let me retell two isolated events before we return to the main yarn.

The first one begins in the damp sewers below The City. The sewers have a rather complex and misshapen layout. This is because
they have to work around the three levels of underground that are in the city. Since the underground had priority, the sewers are crooked.

.

.

.

The sewers are a cold and damp place, a fine setting for a predator on the prowl, just as much as for a prey on the run.
The prey seems to be a little rat. Or at least, that's what they call her. She chose the sewers because she hoped they
would provide an escape from her pursuer, but so far, this hasn't proven to be a viable strategy.

She is scared, horrified even, and frantically running forward, taking the odd turn left or right.

Rat needs to stop for a second to catch her breath. The predator doesn't.

A tall shadowy figure, a strange man, without a doubt, methodically and slowly following the Rat's path.

One foot in front of the other, rhythmically, without a waver.

Left.

Right.

Left.

Right.

Left.

Right.

Like the beating of the drum.

The Rat is on the run once again. She tries to figure out where to go, but fear gets the better of her, and she just ends up running straight
forward.

Unfortunately, as is sometimes found in the predator-prey relationships of the animal kingdom, this is by design. The Rat doesn't realize
that she is slowly being cornered.

She hears the methodical footsteps of her pursuer, but she can't tell where they come from. It appears as if the origin of the sound was in her mind,
inside her skull, radiating outwards.

Left.

Right.

Left

Right.

Rat collapses for a moment, she feels like her head is going to split. Left. Right. Left. Right. After a moment, she regains some of her composure
and starts to run again.

Alas, her sprint leads to a dead end. This is why one should pay attention to maps and facts. Not knowing what you get into predicts loss,
preparedness predicts victory.

There is nowhere to run. Rat is terrified. She collapses to the ground and crawls back to the wall. Breathing heavily.

A tall shadowy figure soon appears. Left. Right. He calmly approaches Fira and extends his hand forward.

The man grabs her by the collar and lifts her off the ground. At first, she tries to struggle, but all resistance seems futile.
She can't bite him and clawing on his arm doesn't help, it is covered by a thick black overcoat. She gives up and remains frozen in fear.

And then, he speaks: "A little rat running around in the sewers, how fitting. I'm sorry Fira,
but I can't have you messing around with this place any longer." And as he finished the sentence, he let go of her, and as he did,
the girl disappeared without a trace.

.

.

.

Elsewhere, several days later. It is night, the sky is clear and the moon is full. Thousands of shiny stars silently glimmer. They are pure and far
removed from the troubles of earthly life. A million years ago, they were shining like this, and a million years later, they will still be there. Silently
shining, like tiny eyes, watching the world tirelessly.

The river is flowing north today. It has been many hours since the sun set and, as maybe unexpected of this city ridden with sin, the place where we are
now seems peaceful and quiet.

A naked woman appears. She has black hair, not too long, not too short. Her body is balanced, like the template for a fit female figure, although perhaps
tilted more towards the slim end of the distribution. Her eyes are red and the pupils have the stretch out over the iris in the shape of a triangle that
had its corners cut off.

The only thing on her is a tight black choker, roughly at the center of her neck.

It is not long since she was released from her master, firmly planted in the physical world, and out to do stuff on her own. There was still some adjusting
to do. Regardless, for tonight, she had a clear goal in her mind.

She walked towards the water and stood for a moment, then went in, until the water covered her feet. It was cold and strange. The cold didn't bother her.

She then slowly backed off and went in again, but instead of walking into it, she walked on the surface of water. There was a circle around her,
where the water was perfect still and flattened.

She headed towards the middle of the river, where the water is deepest.

The river started shining and changed color.

The woman still walked towards the depths.

The river started flowing the other direction.

No matter, even this didn't discourage her.

The river changed color and direction.

She finally reached the center, closed her eyes and laid down on to the water.

The river changed color, direction and again color and shone even brighter.

The woman took a deep breath and... sunk.

The river started changing color and direction rapidly, great waves appeared on the surface, it was like
an animal struggling to escape captivity. Like it was squirming on the ground.

This only intensified. The woman had sunk to the bottom already, like if you threw a stone into a pond.
She was squirming and reaching all over herself as well.

In a moment, the river seemed to have all colors at once and no one could tell which direction it was flowing.

Climax. The water stopped moving and turned black. It started getting colder and colder.

Suddenly, the woman rose out of the water, donning a black halter dress with a wide and ornate skirt, reminiscent
to those of ball dresses, but not as large as the ones you can see in baroque reenactments. On the dress,
there were several brooches, each of them was just a gem set into gold with a pin. One for each color of the river.

As she stepped on the surface, the water underneath her bare foot froze, so did the next step and the next.

The ice started spreading from her footsteps, at first slowly, but then faster and faster, until the water was frozen
as far as eye could see.

The red triangular eyes of the lady of the river were shining like two red moons.

She looked up into the sky, waved her hand over her head and said a single word.

_Mugetsu_. No moon. Starless sky. Eternal night.

Then she walked off, towards the nuclear power plant.

# EPISODE 1: HORUS

The man managed to park his truck in the parking lot for trucks and decided it was time to go for a walk and start exploring.

Elsewhere, but close enough, a short girl has just left the train to go to her friend's flat to drop off something for him.

The sun is shining and a cold, wintry breeze is blowing. The girl is absentmindedly walking on the sidewalk. She remembers an
event from a few years ago which changed her life forever. She is unsure why, perhaps it's the trucks that are driving by on
the road.

As it happens, the man is on the other end of the sidewalk. Two strange fellows are about to pass by one another.

There is still a bit of ice on the sidewalk. It's a leftover of snow from a few weeks ago. The winter has been dry indeed.

The nostalgic daydream of the girl doesn't pay off. She trips and falls right in front of the man.

The man, looking about thirty-five, well-built and muscular, brown-haired, with a skin slightly darker than that of a typical white man,
and with piercing blue eyes stops in front of the fallen girl.

He is surprised, but grabs her by her coat and helps her get back on her feet. She growls angrily.

Then the man spoke:

"Howdy, are you alright? My name is Horus, that's H-O-R-U-S, not Horace, some people confuse the two. And you are?"

"I'm Neiro... thanks."

"Glad to meet you, I'm new to this place, so I don't know how stuff works around here yet."

"How did you get in? They don't let people without a resident card in," Neiro responded. Or something like that, I'm still unsure about the way she speaks.
Cartographer insert out.

"I have a business permit. I am a businessman of sorts. I sell light bulbs and I also have another passion. I adore trinkets and oddities and
I trade for them. I heard there is a lot of strange stuff going on around here, so I came over here personally in hopes of finding some interesting
things... Ah, I'm sorry I talk too much. I have been on the road for quite a while."

Neiro commented on how strange Horus's vocation seems to be, but decided to bid him farewell and go on her merry way.

Horus, however, stopped her and added: "Actually, I'm looking for someone to show me around, you know this city, don't you? Would you
be willing to be my guide?"

Neiro shook her head and declined as politely as she could. She felt a little cranky and wasn't in the mood for some strangers.

Horus presented a counter-offer: "I'm paying". He was a pretty successful businessman with a lot of coin to spare.

An image of a wallet full of only cobwebs flashed through Neiro's mind. Maybe she could use a little extra money,
even though she knew she would be broke again quite quickly anyway. Horus looked well kempt and didn't look to Neiro like the type
to go murdering in a dark alley.

"Okay, I will show you some places, but don't expect much. This city is a dangerous shithole. Also don't be weird."

"Alright, you have my word. Where do we go?"

"I have some errands to run."

"That's fine, what place are we visiting first?"

"My friend Valentine's house. I got something for him."

"Would that happen to be one Valentine Erimez?"

"Yes...? Do you know him!?" said Neiro, slightly concerned. The fact that he knows Val's surname shook her a bit.

"No, I don't know him. Not personally, but I have a shipment for him. Actually, let's take a two-minute detour to my truck,
we will pick up the package, and then we can kill two birds with one stone, how about that?" Horus responded.

"Uh, okay. What do you have for him?"

"This might surprise you, but light bulbs. It's not a big package, only six of them. He is one of the three customers
thanks to whom I have been able to enter The City." Horus explained.

"Why would he order light bulbs from you if you are from so far away?" Neiro was still more than slightly suspicious.

"I make light bulbs like no other. I have a wide assortment of illumination devices for all sorts of use-cases.
You'll see in due time."

Strange.

And so, Neiro and Horus took a detour to the truck parking lot. He showed her his truck, it was a bit scary to her,
not just because it was oversized and armored but also because although the color is different and modifications have been
made to it, the cabin looks like the very same truck that appears in the dreams she has every once in a while, the one
that hit her.

Horus tried: "Look at her, this beautiful beast. This is the best truck ever made, it can deliver anything anywhere
and it's protected, there is no safer place than behind this ship's steering wheel."

It did not help.

"It's my mobile command center, haha. I have a lot of trinkets, oddities and novelty in it. Surely there will be something in it
you'd like."

"No, let's get out of here."

That was it, then. The two made their way towards Valentine's flat.

Neiro knocked on the door and in a moment, Valentine opened the door. He was a black man, with dark-looking eyes,
about the same height as Horus, slim but definitely fit.

Neiro immediately hugged him. She was very cranky before, but now she was excited to see him.

"Look, what the cat dragged in. I'm glad you came, Nei-rou," said Valentine with a smirk.

"Who is this other guy, N?" he added.

"I'm Horus, I have your light bulb shipment. Ampoules Sans Frontiéres Pvt. Ltd.," responded Horus with French
that sounded more like German.

"Uh, Neiro, this isn't the guy was supposed to make the delivery," said Valentine and readied his hand to grab for his dagger,
if it were necessary.

"That is correct, I'm not your local delivery man. I'm the manufacturer, my company produces these.
We accepted a few orders to The City, so I took the opportunity to visit and see it for myself. Sorry for
the misunderstanding. Here's your light bulbs," replied Horus, handing the box to Valentine.

"Okay, then, thanks."

"Pleased to meet you, like I said, my name is Horus. That's 'US' at the end.". Horus extended his hand to shake
Valentine's.

"I'm Valentine."

Valentine shook Horus, but as he did, Horus squeezed his hand as to not let him go and turned Valentine's hand
knuckles up.

"Fancy tattoos, I have never seen any like these before. Do they carry some deeper meaning?" asked Horus curiously.

"Depends, they have meaning for me," says Valentine, shrugging.

"I understand, well, all I can say is that I dig the skulls," responds Horus with a slight friendly smile.

"We should go," Neiro joins the conversation.

"We will talk later, Neiro. Be careful."

"See you, Val."

Neiro and Horus leave. On the way out, Horus asks:
"I couldn't help but notice that your right eye is in a pretty bad shape. You can't see out of it, can you? What happened?"

"No, I can't and it's a long story," responded Neiro, with a slightly angry undertone.

"I see. If it's any consolation," said Horus, "my right eye doesn't see that well either. In my case, nothing happened. It's
been like that for as long as I can remember. So my eyesight isn't that good, but I try to make up for it by making the most
of what I got, by paying attention to things."

A single "Huh" comes out of Neiro as she takes out a cigarette and a lighter. She puts the cigarette in her mouth.

Lighter open, spark, flame, ignite... wait, what? Where is the cigarette?

Neiro snaps out of it and sees that Horus snatched it.

"These are bad for you, you know?" he exclaims.

"Give it back, are you gonna school me about the dangers of smoking!?" says Neiro angrily.

"No far from it, what I'm saying it, these suck," he responds as he throws it away. "I believe, that quality is preferable."

Horus pulls out the cigar from earlier out of the breast pocket of his trench coat.

"Try this, it's better and less cancer. And of course, it's a novelty. See the writing on the side?"

At this point, it only said "you waiting, huh?", the front of it has been burnt off already, still, there was about two
thirds of it left.

"You know how to use it, right?" asked Horus.

"Yea, what did you think?" Neiro was still a bit hostile, but she snatched the cigar out of Horus's hand.
She was angry, but also curious, since she never smoked a cigar before.

Lighter open, spark, flame, ignite, partake.

Neiro immediately starts coughing and wheezing.

Horus starts laughing: "It seems your prowess has been overstated a bit. You don't inhale a cigar like a cigarette,
you will just start coughing and have a bad time. Also there is ten to fifteen times more tobacco in this than
in a cigarette. Moderation is key."

"Here, imagine that you are pulling in from a straw, that's a good way to think about it. You pull in, you let
it sit for a moment and then you blow it out. But don't do it that often, or the cherry will get too heated and
you will start tasting tar."

"Okay, alright." Neiro was embarrassed about her smoking failure.

She tried being more gentle and doing it the way Horus said. It was much better. Unlike the cigarettes, which she
was mostly smoking to take the edge off and to satisfy her addiction, this thing tasted pretty good.
It was actually a pleasant experience. She finally calmed down and daydreamed again.

She pulled in and blew out smoke a few times and then returned to paying attention.

"So.. these light bulbs you are selling, what are they for?" she asked.

"I sell a plenty of types. If you are asking about the ones for Valentine in particular,
those are weed bulbs. They make weed grow better."

If Neiro was drinking coffee right now, she would have spat it out. Unfortunately,
it was just a single cough and a fast exhale: "What?"

"Well, exactly that. They have a specifically calibrated color which emulates just the type of daylight you need
for optimal growth. But, I make many more types of illumination devices. Bordering between shady and legal business
is not all I do."

Neiro, was still a little surprised, but it made sense. She pulled in the cigar again, blew out and said:
"Okay, and what's a cherry?"

"... the burning part of the cigar."

# EPISODE 2: JAKE

> My soul, where are you? Do you hear me? I speak, I call you -
are you there? I have returned, I am here again. I have shaken
the dust of all the lands from my feet, and I have come to you,
I am with you. After long years of long wandering, I have come to you again.
Should I tell you everything I have seen, experienced, and drunk in?
Or do you not want to hear about all the noise of life and the world?
But one thing you must know: the one thing I have learned is that one must live this life.
Do you still know me? How long the separation lasted! Everything has become so different.
And how did I find you? How strange my journey was!
What words should I use to tell you on what twisted paths a good star
has guided me to you? Give me your hand, my almost forgotten soul.
How warm the joy at seeing you again, you long disavowed soul. Life has led me back to you.
Let us thank the life I have lived for all the happy and all the sad hours, for every joy,
for every sadness. My soul, my journey should continue with you.
I will wander with you and ascend to my solitude.

Elsewhere, some time earlier.

Jake was, by all accounts, an ordinary man. He was born and lived most of his life
in Yatoru, working several odd jobs and trying out all sorts of different careers.

He was by no means an uneducated man, but, for some reason, simple, manual jobs
like these were relaxing for him.

In school, he was above average in technical subjects, humanities didn't speak to
him too much.

When he reached adulthood, he first obtained a regular driver's license,
then he went for trucks and buses, and eventually, he even learned how to fly
a helicopter.

Jake has always been a wayward spirit. He moved away from his parents at the
age of twenty and was constantly looking for jobs where he could travel
to a different city, or see things he hasn't seen before.

One fine day, he found an interesting job posting in the newspaper. It was a chance
encounter, really, he didn't really read the newspaper otherwise. It was rather cryptic
in its omission of details, but it promised the things Jake was looking for.

Travel to a different city, fly a helicopter, variety of manual jobs. Like a contractor
and pilot amalgamation. There was a phone number underneath the ad, so he tried to call it.

The person on the other end sounded excited and positive and invited Jake for a interview.
A few days later, Jake went for the interview. It took place in a rather large office building,
it was a little hard to orient oneself in the corporate setting.

Thanks to pointers from the people working there, he was eventually led into an office with
a nice view over the city.

It was winter, so the scene wasn't as vibrant as in, say, spring, but it was a nice sight
nevertheless. One could see hundreds of people moving around and going about their daily
lights, cars driving around, as if they were little bugs looking for food, and houses,
churning white smoke from their chimneys like a person breathing on their hands to keep them
from freezing.

The winter was dry and there was almost no snow, only some icy remnants on the sidewalk.

> If we feel our way into the human secrets of the sick person,
the madness also reveals its system, and we recognize in the
mental illness merely an exceptional reaction to emotional problems
which are not strange to us.

The office apparently belonged to a blonde woman. She looked to Jake about 170cms high,
she had blue eyes and a far more fit, perhaps even muscular, build than one would expect
from a high-ranking office executive.

What looked strange to Jake was that she, despite clearly holding a high position, looked
very young. If he really stretched his imagination, he would say thirty at best, but that would
be one foxy thirty-year old!

The woman shook his hand and introduced herself: "Hello, my name is Eir, welcome to Morpho Inc."

Jake responded: "Ah, hello, I hope I'm in the right place. I'm Jake. I'm sorry, I think I misheard you,
did you say your name was Eir?"

"Haha, yes, that's my name. My parents were of nordic descent. This name was quite common in the country
where they came from. It's like the name Mercy was in US."

The interview followed next. Eir asked Jake for some details about his life, verified that he
has no stains on his criminal record and overall did her best to establish that he is good for the job.

"What job was it anyway?" you might ask. Well, as she explained, the company wanted to establish a
forward operating base in a city, which she said "was not that far". His job would be to occasionally
move some cargo over the city with a helicopter, help with some manual tasks and with organization.
Further details on-site.

Jake was a little suspicious, but his curiosity and his adventurer spirit got the best of him. He said yes.

Finally, the woman added: "Oh, and you might see some strange things. They could look supernatural
or out of this world, or outright scary sometimes, but don't worry, there is nothing to be concerned about.
Oh, and the boss, he will be there leading the operation, he is a little eccentric, don't be alarmed. Is that fine?"

Jake was processing this for a second, then responded: "Meh, I guess so." The pay was very good
and the woman even made a promise that there will be a sizable bonus if everything goes well, so Jake
thought, given the fact that he didn't believe in the supernatural, that this will be fine.

Lastly, the woman added: "Thank you, I'm glad we can do business. Now, here is the place where you need to travel to,
from there, we will provide the transport to the city. If you retain your receipts,
we will cover the travel costs. Also hand in this paper at the receptionist, they will hand you your work overalls
and a complimentary company baseball cap. We might meet at the site, but I will be arriving later, if at all."

Jake spotted an opportunity and said, with a suggestive smile: "We can meet over a drink later, too, if you want." Wink.
It wasn't very effective.

Eir responded: "Well, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid I must decline. You see, if you go drinking
with a nordic blood, you must have started off with the worst handicap ever. I have no interest
in dragging young drunk men from under the table... Again."

Jake was a little disappointed that his attempt failed, but no matter,
"You miss one hundred percent of the shots you don't take," he thought.

> To venture causes anxiety, but not to venture is to lose one's self....
And to venture in the highest is precisely to be conscious of one's self.

The two bid their farewells and Jake returned downstairs to the reception, where he picked
up his new outfit. Both the cap and the overalls were dark blue with a single red stripe on each side.

He was told that he is the last new employee to be accepted and that everyone else is already there.
The instructions were to come as soon as possible, so he returned home, packed a modest backpack and
left his flat first thing in the morning.

Interestingly, the coordinates he was given led to a abandoned farm field, not far from The City.
Jake was quite surprised, he heard about the city before, but had no idea what to expect.
There were apparently some stories about strange events taking place in the city, including a great
fire that nearly led to its destruction not too long ago.

He took a bus as far as he could, near the edge of the ruins and then he had to go by foot. Yatoru
has not established public transport to The City walls, so one could either travel to a gas station
near a smaller city called Gan Adfeilion, which was about two thirds of the way,
and walk the rest, or go to Korubon and then hitchhike
with one of the drivers who ran a supply chain to the distribution center in southern City.

Jake opted for the first option, since it was a few hours shorter and less risky than traveling with
a stranger. People who dealt with The City had less than favorable reputation.

Going to the designated place took several hours. Since it was winter, the days were quite short,
so before Jake arrived at the destination, the sun had already set.

At first, he thought that he was seeing wrong, but there was a man standing in the midst of the ruins,
he was facing the other way, towards the walls.

He wore black formal shoes, dark grey pants, a black overcoat and a wide brim fedora.
He was slightly shorter than Jake, but not by that much.
Thanks to the dark and the hat, it was hard to make out what he looked like.

Jake tried to approach him, when suddenly the man turned around and yelled: "Jake?"

Jake twitched, he was shocked a bit, but after a few seconds responded: "Yes?"

"Hey, I've been waiting for you, come closer," the man said cheerfully and waved at him.

Both of the men started moving to the other, soon enough, they were face to face.

"Hi, glad you're here, Jake. I'm the boss. You will be working for me now."

The two of them shook hands.

"Hello," responded Jake, "am I in the right place? It seems kinda ruined around here,
to be honest."

"Yes, this is the correct place. Now, I will tell you where you need to go next.
And I also got your first assignment. You get to fly a brand new helicopter. It's a Sikorsky H-60/S-70,
utility line. Decommissioned without having taken a single trip before we got to it."

"Hey, that's pretty cool. Isn't that a military helicopter, though? From a different continent, no less?"

"It is, but if you got coin, you can buy them when their 'tenure' ends. We managed to find one
which was just sitting in a warehouse."

"Oh, man, that gets me excited, then, haha," Jake responded in a cheerful tone. "Well, it's a still strange just
standing like this in the dark around some ruins, but this nice helicopter really gets my hopes up."

"Ah, I'm afraid that this is not the end of strange things you are going to see here, heh. Anyways, to your
task. You will arrive at our camp, in an empty area west of the nuclear power plant. We have set up camp there.
There, you can relieve yourself of your backpack and go to sleep. By the next day, the others should mark a heliport
near the camp, so you know where you will have to land.

In the morning, go to the provisions officer, he has a yellow
tag on his back and will probably be running around, distributing equipment, can't miss him. He will give you
a parachute, a helmet and a handgun. The City is dangerous at times, so this is just an insurance in case you'd
need to defend yourself.

You will travel to the other side of the city, to the distribution center. That's where the helicopter
is landed, and it's also where you will meet your co-pilot. They will already be waiting for you. The
staff at the distribution center will attach a large pallet - and it will be also wrapped in a net - of cargo
to the helicopter. Your task will be to take your co-pilot and fly all those supplies to the camp back near
the power plant.

I recommend high altitude, for safety reasons."

Jake nodded his head and said: "I get it. I'll do my best, boss. By the way, can I ask your name? Also, how
do I get into the city, to the camp?"

"Well, you can ask, but I'm afraid I can't give you an answer at this time. Later, sure,
when we have our feet on the ground, but not now.
There are people, who would be none too happy about my presence in The City, and I can't risk someone
will be out to get me before we will have even set up shop."

"Whoa, that sounds dangerous. It feels more like an action movie than a company expansion!" commented Jake.

"Nooo, but it feels like that sometimes, haha. Now, let me be frank with you. There is a military aspect
to our operation, and we need to do some stuff which seems sketchy to the outside observer, but don't worry,
nothing of that is on you. Got it?"

"Uh, alright, I'd prefer to stay out of too much danger, though, if you get me. How sketchy are we talking?"

"Militaristic, weaponized. You'll see. Now, I know what I just said sounds scary, but I was being forward.
Need to cover my bases, you see. Even with employees. I want none of you hurt or shocked or anything.
Everyone has been briefed on what concerns them."

"I see, well I'm curious and a little frightened, not gonna lie."

"I understand that, of course, but you have my word. Not to mention, I can really make this worth your while.
Apart from your payment, I can offer you a golden ingot. Real one, twenty-four carat gold. This might sound
old-fashioned, keeping gold, I mean, but have you seen the prices lately? The last great war used up
a great portion of the world's gold reserves on weapon electronics. Lower supply, bigger price. Let it
sit for a few years and you'll be rich," the boss added.

"Alright, thanks, I'm not really in it for the money, but thank you. Sounds like a rare keepsake to me,"
said Jake.

Jake suddenly heard a strange sound, as if something was dripping.

The man continued: "Oh, I nearly forgot, you asked me how to get into the city. Well, you see the walls,
they are a few minutes away, but they look tall already. So just go ahead towards the walls and you will
get there. Don't worry about anything. Trust me."

Jake listened, but he was trying to locate the source of the dripping. Aha! There it is.

"Uh, Boss, I think you're bleeding from your left hand." Dark droplets were slowly dripping onto the ground.
There was either very low oxygen content in the blood, or it was mixing with some other color.
Maybe the coat? Maybe the hands were dirty, it was possible he was touching some machinery and
got some tar or pitch on his hand. Something like that.

"Oh, that, yea. It will be fine. I guess it's the price you pay if you rush things, haha. Slow
and steady, they say, slow and steady... Anyways, you better get going, same goes for me. I need
to run one more errand first, so I'm going back to my car, it's parked on a road nearby. See you around,
Jake."

"Okay, goodbye, boss."

This was a little perplexing. Jake tried many strange jobs, but not a single one of them began like this.

He started walking towards the walls. It started to get windy.

His path was blocked by a dilapidated bridge. Adjust backpack shoulder straps, examine the obstacle. Climb over it.
Look around at the top. Ruins all around. Wind blowing.

He took out an energy drink from his backpack. Refreshing, recharging. Start walking again.

Wind intensifies. You can hear it whistle through the buildings. Clear sky, more stars appear.
The moon is nearly full.

Wind intensifies. He tries to figure out a way which uses the ruins as a cover. It only helps a bit.
The ruins provide less and less cover the closer you get to The City.

Wind intensifies. It's a warm wind. Unusual for winter. A lot of dust is lifted off the ground,
making it harder to see.

Again, wind intensifies. Jake can't stand it anymore, he has to close his eyes and cover them
for a moment. He reaches behind and tries to blindly search for his sunglasses. Should be somewhere
near the top of the backpack. Can't find them.

The wind starts to slow down. It gets slower and slower, soon enough, it's just a breeze with an occasional
stronger gust.

Jake opens his eyes. He is elsewhere, there are no ruins around him. He can see the camp a few hundred feet of him.
To his right is a nuclear power plant. Wall is behind him.

"What the hell?" he says to himself. He adjusts his backpack and goes to the camp.

There is a few dozen people at the camp. They are wearing similar overalls as him, but the stripes
have different colors or positioning. There is one woman which has two white stripes on one side, none
on the other.

There is also a lot of people in combat gear. They are in all black and are wearing masks. Not a single
inch of skin is showing. They are just idly standing around. Sometimes, one of the overalls points at
a crate or some object and shouts a command and a few of these pick it up and carry it where requested.

Jake walks to the camp. Several people say hi to him. He responds likewise. He can't tell where to go.

Suddenly an older man waves over at Jake, it's the provisions officer. He welcomes and apologizes that
the camp is still in chaos. "We're only just setting up," he explains. He beckons Jake to one of the tents
and hands him the items. Also, he gives him a map of the city.

"I know you were probably expecting to pick these up in the morning, but we are in a kind of a
hurry here, so I'm just giving you the stuff now. Also, you will need these for your way to the
distribution center." He hands him a card and some change. "The card is so you can use the trains,
the change, just in case. Or buy yourself a lunch, I don't care."

Jake is a little confused by the chaos that's going all around him, but he thinks, "fair enough,
it's the first day, this is all to be expected." Another person waves at him and beckons. This time,
it's a woman, she has green stripes in the same pattern as Jake.

She shows him to his bed and gives him a locker key. Jake decides he's had enough, he stores away
his stuff and goes to sleep.

In the morning, it was much more peaceful. He went outside of the tent, then regretted the decision
because it was quite cold for his half-naked body, went back inside, put some clothes on and went outside.

Just as it was promised, there was a heliport ready, next to the camp. He was surprised that it was possible
to make one so early.

He picked up his stuff, opened the map and tried to position himself. In a moment, he was able to
figure out the nearest train station, so he picked up his things and left the camp.

This part of the city was not exactly falling apart, but still, in a not so good shape.
He could clearly tell that this district was worse off.

"Good, I have the gun," he thought. It was a CZ-75, a reliable semi-automatic handgun. It was
a bit outdated, with most of them being produced during the Great War, but it still worked well
for most situations.

Jake had to walk for quite a while in this district and although he saw some strange looking fellows,
nothing happened.

Eventually, he reached the train station. Luckily, the card worked.

After a few minutes, the train arrived. Jake was standing near one of the train doors and was waiting
for it to open. When it did, a short girl sprung out from the train and bumped into Jake hard.
Jake saw that she had something like a burn across her right eye. She looked quite irritated and
was cussing under her breath. He could only make out the words "Fucking forgot".

Strange. Jake boarded the train. He was able to find a seat by the window. So he just sat back and
looked at the city.

The city was split by a river. It had an odd color, like a hint of red, Jake thought that they must be
leaking some garbage into it, and that's why it has that color.

The eastern part was in a noticeably better shape than the western part. Both halves of the city
displayed signs of renovation. In the West, it was often shoddy at best. East was more serious about
rebuilding, some reconstructions were still taking place.

He left the train near the South-East Gate. That was the one where the distribution center was.

After about ten minutes of walking, he reached it. There it was, a majestic Sikorsky, with a fresh
black finish. There was another Morpho worker sitting on the skids. He was eating a sandwich. Must be
the other pilot.

Jake greeted the other man and the two confirmed that they are the pilots. The other pilot then
went into one of the buildings. A few seconds later, he emerged with several other people, who
started attaching the large pallet of goods to the helicopter.

There were all sorts of items on the pallet. Bags, crates, boxes, some machines. A coffee machine,
even. One of the boxes had "GUNZ" written on it in crayon. That was a little suspicious even to Jake.
On the other hand, it was probably be a joke.

Soon, the helicopter was ready for lift off.

Start the engine. One hand on the cyclic, one on the collective. Feet on tail rotor pedals. Lift off slowly.

There is a strong south-west wind. Have to account for that. Adjust balance. Rise up.

Maximum altitude available at this load is a under 1.5 km. Given the warning, Jake would prefer to go higher,
but it's not possible.

"Flight control, this is Morpho-Sikorsky. We are about to take off. Over."

"Roger, Sikorsky. We only have one helicopter, you don't have to introduce yourself. Over."

"Flight control, there is a strong south-west wind, landing may be difficult, please clear the landing zone of any obstacles
before we get there. Over."

"Roger, Sikorsky. We're on it. Over."

.

.

.

"Flight control, we are about to cross the river. Halfway there. Over."

"Roger, we will be ready for you. Over."

Elsewhere, a moment earlier. A man with binoculars is standing on one of the rooftops. He is in green combat gear,
with a black gas mask and a red cape made of thick plastic. Like a raincoat. He has messy blue hair, the dye
is fading in some places, the length of the hair varies from almost none to a few centimeters. There is
no sense or direction to his hairstyle.

He has several grenades attached to his vest, and above them, a sawed off shotgun and a few shells strapped to its barrel.
On his left side, he has a blood bag attached. A hunting knife is dangling from his belt.

> The greatest hazard of all, losing one’s self, can occur very quietly
in the world, as if it were nothing at all. No other loss can occur
so quietly; any other loss - an arm, a leg, five dollars,
a wife, etc. - is sure to be noticed.

Then, the man spoke.

"Ahhh, what a fine fucking day to be alive. Everything goes well, the sun is shining, the wind is blowing,
and I was just about to go do some 'philanthropy', when I see that life has yet another treat for me."

The man coughs, stretches his hands outward and turns around.

"Rejoice brothers, for tonight... we feast."

He turns around again and points at the helicopter

"That"

.

.

"That cannot be carrying anything good. Black helicopters flying over the city..."

"You know, I used to fly one of these, back in the day. And I can tell you, each time we flown one like that
... we were up to no good."

"But one man's war crimes is another man's come-up. I... want what it's carrying. Weapons, explosives, drugs.
Whatever it is, we need that..."

He turns on his heel again, and runs his hands through his hair.

"Now, this is pretty high, a small target... if you are ordinary. But some of us in the city used
to be privy to a kind of a special juice... one that... affects you."

"And now you got it all. Better senses, a healing factor, some other stuff... Anything you could ever want..."

He turns on his heels again, picking up a rocket launcher.

"We are the next step in human evolution. It's *homo ascendens*, the climbing man. Rising through the ranks.
We are the missing evolution link... and it's onto us to return the world to it's proper order..."

"Where weak step aside for the strong, where those who adapt thrive and those who don't are... eliminated.
Seize the day! *Carpe diem*... soon, we shall return the steering wheel of society to nature...
kick-start the natural selection and save evolution. And I promise you..."

The man turned his head to the ground and spoke more quietly.

"And I promise you... that I will return man the primordial freedom he deserves, liberate him from
the chains, and the strings... and the chains... and the strings... Or else my name isn't Voss!"

"Men! Today is the day we begin! Our long work is finally coming to fruition," he said, patting the blood bag
on his side.

And as he said that, he pointed the rocket launcher at the helicopter and fired.

Meanwhile, in the helicopter.

"Flight control, alert, we got incoming," Jake yelled as he tried to steer the helicopter from the path
of the missile.

"We avoided the missile, but the cargo took a hit. We're bleeding goods."

"Roger Sikorsky, try to get back here as soon as you can. We will have to cut our losses. Over. Hurry up,
we are all on edge. Over."

Back on the ground.

"Ah, we missed... Loot is falling from the sky and the wind is spreading it all over the city...
No matter, it appears what you can't do in one hit, you gotta do in two. Hand me the heat-seeking one."

Eject shell, reload rocket launcher. Prime the weapon, fire.

"Mayday, mayday!!! We got -hit, - lost the hind rotor! Mayday, mayday!! -can't control the -copter."

"Abandon ship, Sikorsky, get out of there."

Jake and the co-pilot jumped out of the helicopter and deployed their parachutes. The helicopter continued
to plummet down and ended up crashing into the river near one of the bridges.

The two pilots were slowly gliding towards the camp.

From up here, the city looks so peaceful. It's... surreal. There is something solemn about it,
and noble. A man's ideal washed away by the years can still shine through if you look closely.
An ambition which turned into something entirely different.

The peace only lasts for a few seconds as gunshots start to fly by the two parachutists.

They try swerving from side to side to avoid the bullets. Co-pilot's parachute gets hit several times,
Jake's only twice. Co-pilot starts to descent faster than Jake.

He ends up somewhere in the western district, while Jake makes it to the camp.

He collapses to the ground, sweaty and breathing heavily. He loses consciousness.

Back on the rooftops.

"Now, gentlemen, I'd only call this a partial success, but a success nevertheless. Now, some of you, go sweep
the streets around us, there is some cargo, we need everything we can get..."

"The rest of you... refill your blood bags and prepare the sleeping gas grenades and flash-bangs. We are going to
hunt us a... white dove."

Elsewhere, last night.

The music is extremely loud. It has a fast-paced rhythm and is in style reminiscent of the 80s.

The neon lights are flashing brightly, it's enough to give a seizure to many.

A man is stumbling around the club, his entire world is spinning, he is seeing double
and he keeps seeing afterimages. He feels sick and he can't keep his balance.

He has no idea where is he, or how he got there. He tries to think what the hell did he do,
but his mind only keeps producing a random string of words instead of cohesive thoughts.

"Maybe rubbing my eyes will help," says a tiny voice somewhere inside his head. It doesn't
improve a situation one bit. The man used too much force and now his vision is even blurrier.

Alright, it is time to get out of here. Where is the exit again? Or was it the entry?
What's the difference? These thoughts and other similar ones keep popping up in the man's head.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>STARRING</b></div>

He looks somewhere in his early twenties, not very muscular, more on the skinny end of the
distribution, even, his black hair seemingly has a mind of its own and forms two large cones,
one on each side of his head. He looks sickly, his pupils are heavily dilated, he looks pale
and glistens with sweat.

There is not a single organized memory in his mind. He keeps seeing flashing images, but
he can't piece it together, no matter how hard he tries.

He nearly forgot: it is time to get out of here. But how? Oh, there is an open window,
maybe he can climb out of it, or so he thinks.

Approach window, grab with arms, jump out, freedom. Sounds easy enough, but there is
a discrepancy between mind and body, it is not easy to coordinate this escape plan.

A moment later, we are set to go, now to just leap out of the window.

3... 2... 1... Jump! Oh no, there has been a miscalculation. The man didn't notice that
this isn't the ground level but the second floor. This one is going to hurt.

Adrenaline rushes through the entire body as he braces for impact.

Ouch! Luckily, he fell into some garbage and is relatively unscathed. The hind side is going
to be painful in the morning, though.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>NEIRO</b> AS THE WINGED ONE</div>

As the man lies in the garbage a butterfly catches his attention. What's this butterfly doing
here? And at night? He must have startled it when he fell.

It is a nice, big blue one. The wings have a black outline. When its wings are closed, it looks
like an eye is staring at you. That is, of course, on purpose, it is what butterflies do to deter
predators.

He tries to reach it, but it flies away.

It is time to get up. First, roll over. Slide down from the garbage. Engage 4x4 movement mode.
Crawl to a wall. Use wall to get back on feet.

The world is spinning even more now. He feels cold. There is no clear goal of his current adventure,
he has no idea where he came from or where he needs to go, but still, he tries to push forward.

Slowly stumbling through the streets. Walls of buildings offer support when necessary.

The entire world is blurry. He tries to look up into the sky, but he is overcome by a sudden spell of
vertigo and has to grab a wall again. Alright good, we are stable again. He feels very hot. So hot,
in fact, that he throws away his sweatshirt. It is winter.
<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>LOKI</b> AS THE AMNESIAC</div>
He stops to breath and finally manages to look up.

The stars are shining bright as winter stars are wont to do and shimmer silently.
In his current state, they are far and yet look very close. He tries to reach them, but he can't.
In his eyes, the stars move and shift, from side to side, some appear to brighten up, other dim down.
Constellations are twisting and turning. The sky comes to life.

If he weren't so out of it, maybe he would've stopped to consider, if this is not the constellations
playing out their stories. A recording of history made by ancient men, forever encoded in the stars
by the shapes we attribute to them.

He briefly shudders and then once again stumbles forward again while still looking at the stars.
He feels cold again.

After a few moments, the adventurer feels a blunt pain. He walked into a pole with a fair bit of force.
A few droplets of blood start flowing from the side of his head.

He grabs on the floor and feels a sudden spell go over him. Oh no, this one isn't going to be fine.

The adventurer starts vomiting over the pavement. He feels extremely sick, must have hit his
head fairly hard.

He can no longer stand up on his feet, the wall is too far and the pole does not seem like a help
to him. Besides, he christened the pole too, and, despite his condition, didn't want to touch it.
<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>FIRA</b> AS THE CODE</div>
He feels hot again. Feeling a bit of panic and fear over his state, he tries to look around for
something that might help. Ah, a bench!

Crawling along the ground is much harder this time. Left arm. Right leg. Right arm. Left leg. Right leg...?
Right arm...? Right left? Crawling is suddenly a very confusing activity for our man in peril.

Fortunately, within a few minutes, he manages to reach the bench. It takes several attempts to
lift himself up enough to be able to crash into the bench.

The adventurer tries to think what to do next, but Fate, the cruel mistress that she is, has a different plan
for him.

The entire world, still spinning and swinging from side to side becomes blurrier and blurrier...
and darker... and darker...

.

.

.

.

The man has a strange dream. One of chaotic images flashing fast, here and there.
<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>HORUS</b> AS THE MAKESHIFT NURSE</div>
Every time he tries to focus on a single one it seems to disappear and he can feel
his head hurting, despite this being a dream.

.

Suddenly, he finds himself back in The City. It is morning, the skies are gray and it is raining.
But the rain isn't as most rains are. There is some dark matter in the droplets which leaves stains
on whatever the droplet lands on.

Is it tar? Is it paint? Is it dirt? No, doesn't seem like it. There is something strange about the way
the impurities diffuse in the water.

He finally figures it out. It is ink. And suddenly he can see around himself that the droplets
aren't everything falling from the skies. So are dozens of dead octopuses, squids, crabs and jellyfish.
The ink probably seeped from their dead bodies. The crabs clack and crack when they hit the ground,
the rest loudly splats.

A vague shadow of something indescribably monumental and awe-striking appears through the clouds.
It must be as big as the city and - oh horror! - it moves!

A giant octopus the size of a city block falls from the sky suddenly. It lands in the area where
the adventurer is standing, and streets flood with a mix of blue octopus blood and ink.

The first wave is only up to the adventurer's knees, but the level continues to rise quickly.

Seconds later, it is up to his neck and a few seconds after that, he sinks.

.

He is under the sea right now, sinking down to the sea bed. The water washes away the blood
and the ink.
<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>MINERVA</b> AS THE EX</div>
He tries to float up, but he can't, the surface seems to be infinitely far. He can't see the sea bottom
either.

The man struggles hard, but he runs out of breath quickly. The world starts to become dark again,
before his instincts finally give in and he breathes in the water.

However, the water seems breathable, very strange. He breathes in and out a few times to confirm.

He tries screaming. A moment later, his echo comes back perhaps even louder.

"Is someone here?" the man yells into the sea.

"Someone here?" responds the echo.

"Is there anyone here but me?" he tries again.

"me?" comes back.

"I'm searching for a way out, help!"

"I'm searching."
<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>MAGNUSI</b> AS THE VISITOR</div>

There is no point in this, he thinks. It's just a strange echo.

The adventurer floats for a moment and tries to look around if he sees something other than water.

"I CAN'T FIND IT" loudly comes from all sides, in the same way the echo did.

"I CAN'T FIND IT".

"I CAN'T." It is an echo, but it sounds full of wrath, unlike the way the man spoke seconds ago

The sea starts shaking violently, as if there was an earthquake propagating through it. Suddenly a vortex opens
not far from the man and spins faster than any vortex that can be seen on Earth.

He tries to swim away, but the force pulling him in is just too strong. He is sucked in and thrown into the center of
the vortex, where there is no water and just air.

He starts falling and gaining speed very quickly, when suddenly, the dream ends.

.

Back in real life, the man, still unconscious or sleeping, vomits again. Luckily, his head was dangling down from the
bench, so there is no risk of choking.
<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>ENDELL</b> AS THE MECHANIC</div>

.

.

Elsewhere, a dozen hours earlier.

Minerva was a peddler of sorts. She dealt in some drugs, information and other contraband.
She has been doing this for a very long time and she was very good at what she was doing.

Although it wasn't her dream vocation, she had talents which were inclined towards sciences in a way
that helped her job.

In the eyes of most men, and women, she was a fox. A feisty seductress, if there ever was one.

She had long red hair and a golden tooth, a taste for fine clothing, and an air about herself
which was disarming to many.

However, this "many" didn't include Endell. He was her ex-boyfriend from what seemed like a long time ago.
For him, she was mostly a headache, although the two managed to reconcile with time.

Speaking of headaches, Minerva was suffering one right at this moment. She had a new girlfriend for
some time, a young-looking girl with a, let's say, "ratty disposition". She was just as eccentric as Minerva,
but in a completely different way. Despite this, and their disparity in temperaments - Minerva was far more mature -
it seemed to click.
<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>HENRY CROSS</b> AS HENRY CROSS</div>
However, it has been a few days since Minerva last saw her. She disappeared seemingly without a trace and this
was worrying. She was afraid that something happened to her girlfriend. After all, this was a dangerous city.

Minerva tried many of her contacts and called several of her friends, but no one knew where she went or
how she disappeared. One account vaguely remembered seeing someone looking like her girl being followed
by a strange man. This was all the more worrying.

Now, she felt helpless. There was nothing she could do except try as hard as she could to learn something
about where her girlfriend could be.

Worrying thoughts were all that was on her mind the entire evening. That is, until someone knocked at the door.

Minerva, being well-versed in the ways of less honorable men, took her weapon of choice with before going
to check the door.

She laid it on a counter next to her door and looked through the peephole. Outside stood a man in a suit.

The suit wasn't in a particularly good shape and probably hasn't been worked or cleaned in a long time. Minerva
immediately noticed that.

To Minerva, the man looked a little fidgety and perhaps a bit shy,
but it seemed he was trying his best to appear normal and friendly.
She was feeling a bit defensive due to the current circumstances.

He was definitely a bit over thirty, he had hair of uneven length, but combed back to seem as presentable
as possible. He had brown contacts, so it was hard to tell what his original eye color was.
In one of his hands was a linen bag. It was possible to make out the outline of two items, a bottle and a box.

"What do you want?" Minerva yelled through the door.

"Hiya, don't worry, I come in peace and unarmed," he said, putting his hands in the air, then turning on his heel
and back.

"I'm... Cross, old friend of Endell's. I'm looking for him and I was hoping you'd know where he lives, haha!"
continued, scratching his head and stepping from side to side.

He was very animated.

"I've never heard of you." said Minerva coldly.

"Oh no, that old rascal never mentioned me. What about... Henry? That's my first name, maybe he mentioned me
by that name."

"Never heard about a Henry either."

"That's a shame, doing his old friend in like that. But well, Endell was always a bit cold wasn't he.
I mean, look at his eyes and skin. A total ice man!". He turned on his heel.

"But I'm really one of his friends, rest assured.". He turned on his heel back to face the door and stretched his
arms out.

"Sheesh, you are annoying, alright. Take of your coat, throw it to the side and put your hands up."

"Alright, just don't shoot, haha!". He did as she instructed.

Minerva unlocked the door and patted him down. He really wasn't armed. Now, there was a gun in his crotch alright,
Minerva felt that, but not the kind that kills people... more like the opposite.

Minerva pointed her weapon at him and put on a very stern look: "Alright, spill it out. If you are his friend from old days,
then you must know that Endell was in some shady stuff when he was younger. That means you were probably, too. Spill the beans."

The man stepped two steps back and put on a shocked face: "Fine, I concede, I'm a Modified, too, and I met him in the underground,
but I was never really involved with the underground and kinda split off, just like he did. He was good to me all those years
back and now that I've finally managed to pull myself together, I'd like to surprise him and speak to him again."

He tried to turn on his heel, but Minerva interrupted him: "DON'T... MOVE". The man froze in his tracks.

"Hey, look, miss Cerees... I bring gifts." he reached into his bag and pulled out a bottle of wine.

"This is for you, as a sign of good will. Here, it's the Silver '30, a really fine year, hard to come by!"

Minerva saw that this is a really good bottle. "Thanks, what's the other thing in your bag?" - she still wasn't convinced.

"It's my gift for Endell, look. It's a commemorative M9A1 handgun. It used to be standard issue for the military,
this one is a special edition with engravings, very rare. Don't worry, it's unloaded and all, and more of a collector's
piece than anything else. I thought he would appreciate it."

"How did you get your hands on it here in The City?"

"Oh, I had it imported. The bottle too."

Minerva let her guard down a bit finally. The man still looked strange to her, but not dangerous-strange.

"Fine, I will tell you where he lives, but if something happens to him or his girlfriend, I will murder you."

The man attempted to made a friendly pleading gesture as if to lighten the atmosphere.
Minerva shared where Endell lives.

"Thank you, so much. I'm sorry I'm probably annoying you, but I really appreciate this."

"Hmm. I'm sorry I was too aggressive. You see, my girlfriend has gone missing and I'm really
upset about it"

"Oh my, I'm terribly sorry. If there is anything I can do, just let me know. Here is my calling card.
I am not good for much, but anything to help Endell's friends," he said with a slight smile. One of the corners
of his mouth twitched as he said it.

Minerva took the card and then went inside mouthing "goodbye" at the stranger.

The man went back on the street, turned on his heel, stretched his entire body and then ran his hands through
his hair, destroying any semblance of a hairstyle. Hints of greenish blue could be spotted in his hair.

"White dove... located" he thought to himself, letting off a sly smile and cracking his back.
"Today will be... a good day."

He stretched his arms out, looked up into the sky and took a deep breath. He then pulled out his contacts
to reveal clear blue eyes.

# INTERLUDE: MEMORY DATASTORE 15B9B298SY79298N0NS76 > ZmlyYSBhbmQgbWFn

Elsewhere, about a 100 years ago.

Fira Angelica was a pirate.

Her quest for immortality has been changed forever by the realization of
her true nature.

A series of unfortunate events led to an adventure never before seen in this
world.

Right now, she, her brother Azwater and the rest of the crew were escaping their pursuers,
with only two days between their ship and the ships of those, who were after them.

Azwater, Fira and the crew were running low on supplies and Geoffrey Brimes
was injured, they urgently needed to make a stop.

It took them three days of sailing to reach Dead Whale Port, the closest pirate
sanctuary. Now, the rules of the port were similar to many other pirate-ran locations.
Regardless of your relationships with other pirates, no combat was allowed within
its waters. There was the rest of the Pirate Code too, but that's too long to explain.

It was evening when their ship landed in the port. They had to restock as quickly
as possible and Geoffrey needed his wound tended to, so the entire crew sprung out of
the ship like a well-fired cannonball. Well, apart from Geoffrey, he needed Benji
to help him get to the healer.

Dead Whale Port was home to the finest pubs in the area and most members of the
crew knew that. Since it turned out that not all of them were needed to restock the ship,
Shizo Ran invited Fira for a drink.

They went into the closest pub to their ship. It was a open building, so they had
a beatiful view of the sea. Older, more experienced pirates seemed to like this pub
because of this, because for a true sea rover, the ocean was the only true love.

Shizo ran signalled over to the waitress: "A beer for me and for the lady!"

"Ah, thank you," Fira responded, blushing slightly.

A short while later, they both had a pint in front of them.

"Cheers," they both said, touching their jugs of beer.

...

"You know, if we succeed in this quest, I'd like to come here again. I like this place,"
said Fira suddenly with dreamy eyes.

"Yeah, I like it here too," responded Shizo with smile.

Shizo diverted his attention to Fira's jug: "Hey, don't over do it, you kiddo! If you
drink this fast, you will end up under the table! You know you are a lightweight, even for beer,"
he said with a smirk.

"No, I'm not, eeek," Fira retorted, slightly embarrassed after their previous experiences,
"and I'm not a kiddo".

"Oh, I'm sorry, it's just when you are this short, I mistook you for a toddler". Shizo was
having a very good time at the moment.

Fira let out a growl. She had soon almost finished the beer. She and Shizo chit-chatted about
their journey and discussed the future plans their crew had, but suddenly, they were interrupted
by Benji, who joined them at the table.

"Hey, what are you two doing here? Are you babysitting, Shizo?" Benji started.

"Not yet, but hey, lay off her, I already bullied her about that a few minutes ago."

"Well, sure, I guess. I'm here just to have a quick pint anyway. I need to pick up old Brimes
in a bit. He will be good, apparently, the wound wasn't hard to heal, but he won't be able to
walk for a few more days."

"Oh, that's good to hear," Fira responded, "I mean... the fact that he will be okay is great, not that
he will need a few days to recover," she corrected herself.

"Yea, it's great, but the geezer is more insufferable than ever, haha. I think we are going
to hear all about it for the next month or so."

Shizo laughed: "A month? That's optimistic. I mean, I like to tell stories, but I'm no match for a cranky
vindictive Brimes. Until the end of our journey, I say! Not a minute earlier."

Fira was enjoying the smalltalk with her friends, but she noticed something that put her on her edge.
There was someone watching her.

A man donning a black dress with a black coat over it, and a black hat with a large white feather. Most of his
face was obscured by the hat, but she could tell that he was watching her from the other end of the pub.
She only briefly saw a flash of his eyes and they looked... red? She thought she must be mistaken.

Anyways, it was probably just her imagination playing tricks on her. Her recent life has been a
rollercoaster, it was most likely making her be not herself her a bit. Or so she thought.
A more pressing question was on her mind, now that she learned who she really ways. "What am I
really like?"

She was absorbed in her thought for a bit, but she was disturbed by Benji and Shizo reacting to someone
coming over to them.

It was the strange man in black. He really had red eyes with a triangular pupil. Fira noticed one of his
eyes spinning a tiny bit.

"I'm sorry, gentlemen and gentleladies," looking at Fira, "to interrupt you this fine evening. I come in peace
a fellow lover of the sea to fellow lovers of the sea and I would like to ask you, gentlemen, if I could borrow the
lady for a minute? Don't worry, I just want to speak to her for a minute."

"No, thank you," responded Fira. She didn't know this man and frankly, she was a little scared about his visage.

"I'm sorry, matey, not today, go bother someone else. We are in a hurry" responded Shizo and Benji.

"Oh, I see, then," responded the man.

He leaned over to Fira and whispered something in her ear. Fira froze and became white as a wall.
Very pale.

She said: "Excuse me for a moment, boys, I will be right back." and went to an open walk-in tent
with the man.

The man began: "Like I said, you are artificial."

"How do you know that?"

"I am not really a human. Call me mag or magnusi, by the way, nice to meet you. My eyes are special and they can see
that your inner structure is very symmetrical and perfectly laid out. Your bones, some organs and so on.
As if it was by design. Furthermore, there is a hole in your neck, which only got covered by your skin,
but doesn't seem to make any attempt to fill itself with tissue. As if it was a slot for something."

"Alright, you are right, I'm artificial, I was made by someone. I'm just some complex code, it seems. What do you want from me?"

"Nothing, I was just being curious. I too am a part biologically artificial, but in my case, I did it myself.
Now then, I'm interested in who made you."

"He is called Echo, and he is a god."

"A 'god' you say? Oh...," continued mag with a sly smile, "well I know about few of them. Some people count me
in that category, too. You see, I got some strange powers and a very large number of years under my belt, haha. Tell me more."

Fira then continued explaining her condition, about who she is, who Echo is and how he treats her, who Ciara is
and how Fira's whole ordeal works, and why she is on her quest for immortality..
Without really knowing why, she tried as best as she could to piece together the information she had available in this world.

"Interesting, I have never heard about anything like this. It seems that me and my boys operate slightly differently
than this Echo god. Curious."

mag continued: "Well, I cannot bestow immortality upon you or your brother unfortunately, but I can give you
a little something to maybe help you on your way."

magnusi pulled out a vial and slit his wrist, using his abilities to softly and silently guide the blood into the the vial.

Then he pulled out a cork and sealed it.

"Look, this is my blood. It will help heal any wound better than most medicines there are. But beware, you have to be subtle.
My blood is toxic in a way, in that it spreads my essence into others as a sort of a poison, so don't use too much of it on one
person, or else they might suffer some unwelcome side-effects including developing insanity and some of my powers for a short while."

"Thank you, very much. It's a great help," Fira responded, but she was a little worried about the warnings magnusi gave her.

"There is one more thing. Come closer."
Fira did.

magnusi took her head and put it against his, so that the two of them were touching on their foreheads.

"Now, look into my eyes." magnusi's eyes were spinning and jerking a little, like if you try to focus a camera, until
they reached a synchronized position with one of the triangles' points pointing up.

"Recall everything you can about this god of yours and whatever else you consider important."
Fira didn't know what she would consider important on such a short notice, so her thoughts were really all
over the place.

"Alright," continued magnusi.

Then his eyes spun left rapidly for a fraction of a second, Fira suddenly felt a spell of nausea and walked a few steps
away from mag while holding her eyes and her head.

"What the hell was that?" she asked.

"I took some information. That is my price."

He then pulled out his golden parachronal stopwatch.

"Unfortunately, I was hoping I would be able to talk to you for a while longer, but it appears that time is not on
my side right now. And neither on yours, as you said. You better hurry back to your ship. I'm hoping that we will meet again in the
future."

"Thank you for your help. Good-bye." responded Fira, walking away, now slightly more optimistic and waving. She thought that
if it came to worst and they didn't have the immortality for Azwater and herself, then maybe she could at least heal her brother.

magnusi, however, had to leave the world and would end up barred from ever returning to it.

Fira choose to keep the vial a secret for now, maybe forever, given the warnings, and she lied to the rest of the crew
about the meeting, saying that he was trying to convince her to join her crew by saying he knows about immortality,
but that in reality, he didn't seem to know anything they hadn't already learned during their adventure.
