> As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.

Turn the key, the engine kicks in and starts to whir. One last checkpoint before the destination.

Step on clutch, shift gears.

The massive armored truck starts to move. It's a heavy, colossal machine.
If you drive only a small car, then tough luck, you don't stand a chance against this monster.

Step on clutch, shift gears.

Trucks like these have many more gears than regular cars. It helps when going uphill, or when
the cargo is heavy.

The driver adjusts the revue mirror. One should only do this before the vehicle starts to move,
but there is no one and the truck isn't moving that fast yet.

The exit gate opens, the way is clear.

Step on clutch, shift gears. Repeat.

There is a small astronaut hanging from the rear view mirror. The symbol of man's greatest ambition.
Its head is comically large.

> You're going to pay a price for every bloody thing you do
and everything you don't do. You don't get to choose to not
pay a price. You get to choose which poison you're
going to take. That's it.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>STARRING</b></div>

As he drives, the man can't help but notice the slowly deteriorating quality of the road. The asphalt is faded,
cracked and there is the occasional pothole here and there.

Step on clutch, shift gears.

The road is completely empty, he can let loose a bit. Let's see if this tank can still go as fast as he remembers it.

It's winter, but there is no snow on the road, luckily. Or anywhere around, for that matter. In this region,
the winter has been particularly dry.

The road is less asphalt more earth now and so the twenty wheels start to leave a trail of dust and dirt.
From the behind, it might look like the aftermath of a sandstorm.

Step on clutch, shift gears. Foot slips, the transmission lets out an agonizing scream. The foot isn't as
sensitive and dependable as it used to be years ago.

The man turns on the radio. Right now, they are playing "Short Change Hero" by "The Heavy". It's a pretty nice song.

It speaks about running away from problems, a place ill-suited for a hero
and the perspective of the eponymous "short change hero". That is, an outcast and who possesses undesirable or unethical qualities,
but, despite that, tries to be the hero during difficult times and events, out of compassion or honor.

Step on clutch, shift gears.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>HORUS</b> AS THE LIGHT BULB SALESMAN</div>

> Life is suffering<br>
Love is the desire to see unnecessary suffering ameliorated<br>
Truth is the handmaiden of love<br>
Dialogue is the pathway to truth<br>
Humility is recognition of personal insufficiency and the willingness to learn<br>

The tachometer is approaching 80 miles per hour. This is slightly faster than what this road supports for this kind of vehicle.
The enormous cloud of dust is a testament to that.

Out of the truck, the driver notices that every now and then, ruins appear in the surroundings. They are all sorts of buildings.

Some are large, some are small. There is one that looks like a convenience store. That one could have been a gas station.

One cannot help but wonder what happened, that would cause such strange, oddly lonely, ruins to be all around the place.

Nature calls, it's time to stop for a moment.

Step on clutch, shift to neutral. Lightly step on break, slowly come to the stop. It feels like gliding and it almost
evokes the notion that perhaps, this iron beast, has a little finesse in it as well.

Exit the truck. It's surprisingly windy here. The driver couldn't tell from the truck,
there were no trees or other vegetation that would give it away. Ruins don't bend to the will of the wind.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>NEIRO</b> AS THE ACCIDENTAL GUIDE</div>

As all men know, relieving oneself in windy weather requires certain positioning. Wind from the back is optimal and increases effective firing range,
but any angle that is outward is fine.

The driver stepped off the road and over the ditch, as he didn't want to sully it. It's already bad as it is.

Unzip zipper, ready, fire. Soon enough, the bladder is at peace once more. It wasn't the only thing at peace though.
There was something solemn about this place, as ruined and barren as it was, and the man felt that.

He sullied these hallowed grounds with the remains of the fluid intake of days past, it would make sense to honor it with something more
palatable, he thought.

Open the right door of the truck and reach in to the shotgun seat's compartment. He pulls out a box of cigars.

Calling the passenger seat shotgun is quite a strange phenomenon. It used to be associated with carriages and the
idea of a gun-toting partner in a reckless mobile shootout in the old wild West, but it's faux. It was invented by Westerns, it's a fake.

The cigars are, much like most things in the truck, a novelty. They bear the logo of one old game and in seemingly golden letters,
there is a sentence etched into them: "Kept you waiting, huh?"

Lighter out, open, spark, ignite, partake.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>???</b> AS THE SHADOWY FIGURE</div>

These are not great for your lungs. The man was well aware. His lungs breathed in much worse before, though, he thought.
This should be the equivalent of a fresh smelling rose garden in contrast to the past.

Some things stay with you for the duration of your life. A fair number of them stays in the lungs.

It took a while to get into the right mood. The man was no smoker, it was an occasional endeavor at best. Something to take the
edge off, once in a while.

All around, it was silent. All one could hear was the muffled sound of the last bits of "Short Change Hero" coming from inside the truck.
It was peaceful, and lonely. Long ago has this place been claimed the kingdom of genius loci.

As he put out the cigar and stored it away in his trench coat's pocket, the man noticed something flying in the wind towards him.
At first, it looked like a bag, the kind made out of linen or some other fabric, but the shape didn't look quite right.

The man stepped a little to the side, so he was right in the path of the flying object, and just as it was passing by him, caught it with his hand.

It was an apron. The kind that baristas, or sometimes bartenders, wear. There was some writing on it in the corner, but it was hard to make out
over the scorch marks that were all over it. The first letter the man could distinguish to be K. A K-something, then.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>FIRA</b> AS THE RAT</div>

Must have been a fire. Quite some time ago, if it was from the ruins. If it was from one of the cities, most probably the destination one,
it would still have taken months if not years for the wind to carry it this far.

> "No tree can grow to Heaven,” adds the ever-terrifying Carl Gustav Jung,
psychoanalyst extraordinaire, “unless its roots reach down to Hell."

This apron is an odd encounter, thought the man. And it was the kind of oddity that attracted him. A fine addition to his collection.

He gently folded it up and went to the back of the truck.

Unlock, lift iron bar, pull door open. Turn the lights on.

Everything inside was in order. He was a little fearful that his shipment of light bulbs might have been damaged by the reckless driving,
but luckily, no such thing did happen. It's fragile cargo, yes, but if handled well, it will be fine even if a rocket hits the truck.

This container was much bigger than the ones that could have been commonly seen on cargo ships in the days of yore. It was about a meter wider
on each side, a meter and a half taller, and a meter longer than the standard dimensions.

This allowed for two floors to fit into the container, each of which was lined with shelves containing all sorts of things. It also provided
for quite comfortable living quarters when on the road.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>JAKE</b> AS THE PILOT</div>

After thinking for a moment, the man has found the perfect place for the apron and secured it with elastic rope. This, along with the fact
that the shelves were bolted to the interior walls of the container, ensured that nothing, that wasn't supposed to be moving, could move.

Close door, secure with iron bar, lock, pat the container as if to appreciate its good work. Time hit the road again.

> "Every bit of learning is a little death.
Every bit of new information challenges a previous
conception, forcing it to dissolve into chaos before
it can be reborn as something better."

Turn the key, the engine kicks in and starts to whir.

Step on clutch, shift gears. The beast starts to roll again. What a strange place this was.

He wonders if the way back will feel the same way, or if it will be "old news", at that point.

Step on clutch, shift gears.

Repeat.

The radio starts to only produce static, it seems like there is no broadcast the way he's headed.

No matter, there is still a lot of tapes and other media to play. The driver owns several a few boxes of just music.

Step on clutch, shift gears. Damn, all music is in the container. Staring at the road it is.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>&lt;MISSING&gt;</b> AS THE LADY OF THE RIVER</div>

Unfortunately, there is nothing interesting anymore.

Step on clutch, shift gears. Poke the astronaut. It swings from side to side.
It should now be only half an hour until the destination. Luckily, it doesn't seem like there will be a queue
at the entry gates.

Roll the window down a little, wind blows through hair and into the face. The man retrieves sunglasses from his glass compartment.
They are a novelty as well, of course. The temples of the specs are adorned on one side with a cracked skull and, on the other,
with a Rubik's cube.

An artist had them custom-made decades ago. The Rubik's cube is the representation of the infinity of problems, since there are thousands
times more configurations than grains of sand on Earth.

The cracked skull resembles the ancient supercontinent of Pangaea. It reminds of the last time
the entire world was truly connected and of the importance of connections.

> Loneliness does not come from having no people around you,
but from being unable to communicate the things that
seem important to you.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right">AND</div>

Step on clutch, shift gears.

The city finally shows up on the horizon. The walls are very tall and let off an oppressive atmosphere. Their monumentality
is a testament to the separating power they possess, of what needs to be kept out, or, more precisely, of what needs to be kept in.

Tiny hints of smoke can be seen over the walls. It's the houses trying to stay warm during the winter.

Finding a map of the city was a difficult endeavor, at best. One could only find rough ones, but the driver had a rough idea where he needs to go.
There is a parking lot for trucks next to the largely abandoned industrial area. And this was itself close to the entry gate.

<div data-aos="fade-right" style="margin-right: 80rem; margin-left: -47rem; width: 45rem; text-align: right"><b>CPT. VOSS</b> AS ROCKET LAUNCHER</div>

Finally at the gates. There was no other vehicle waiting for entry or attempting to leave.

Shut the engine, remove key from ignition, poke the astronaut.

The man took his documents from the glove compartment. Details about his shipment and his newly assigned business permit.
The documents requested a three-day stay, excluding day of arrival and day of departure.

> One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light,
but by making the darkness conscious. The latter procedure, however,
is disagreeable and therefore not popular.

The man approaches the booth that governs the massive gate, behind which the city lights.

Freeze frame, stop.

Time to digress for a moment. I haven't properly introduced myself yet.

# INTERMEZZO: THE CARTOGRAPHER

I'm sorry for not admitting my existence earlier. I got completely absorbed in my attempt at story telling.

Very well, then.

Hello, I welcome you, dear listener. On this most auspicious of nights, let me recount a series of strange events that make a story,
one that I hope will be compelling, even if only a bit.

However, I must warn you - I'm a cartographer, not a writer or a storyteller, I work with maps and fact-sheets,
the telling of a story, despite being a newfound hobby of mine, still largely remains an enigma to me.
I cannot accurately convey the feelings, the oddities or the speech patterns of people I have never met in person.

I am still experimenting with some ways of dramatization and attempts to convey meaning and emotion, but for the most part, you,
dear listener, will have to read between the lines and infer the feelings and meanings yourself from context and the data I present.

Now, the data I'm privy to is very thorough and it records the events without a slightest hint of doubt, but it lacks life.
It's cold and hard and more suitable for a person like me, but not for a passionate listener, such as you are, undoubtedly.

Therefore, I try to withhold some information and present events in order which I hope might create a good story, with suspense
and meaning and flow. All that which you expect from a literary masterpiece, or a podcast or a movie.

So please, try to infer what's missing and extrapolate from presented data, and I wish you to get as much enjoyment out of this as I do.

This is a role-play of one strange cartographer, a man new to the waters of storytelling, so please, be gentle. In return, I will
try to make up for my imperfections with my virtues. I have got some items of interest prepared for later.

Alright, let's get back to it then. But first, let me retell two isolated events before we return to the main yarn.

The first one begins in the damp sewers below The City. The sewers have a rather complex and misshapen layout. This is because
they have to work around the three levels of underground that are in the city. Since the underground had priority, the sewers are crooked.

.

.

.

The sewers are a cold and damp place, a fine setting for a predator on the prowl, just as much as for a prey on the run.
The prey seems to be a little rat. Or at least, that's what they call her. She chose the sewers because she hoped they
would provide an escape from her pursuer, but so far, this hasn't proven to be a viable strategy.

She is scared, horrified even, and frantically running forward, taking the odd turn left or right.

Rat needs to stop for a second to catch her breath. The predator doesn't.

A tall shadowy figure, a strange man, without a doubt, methodically and slowly following the Rat's path.

One foot in front of the other, rhythmically, without a waver.

Left.

Right.

Left.

Right.

Left.

Right.

Like the beating of the drum.

The Rat is on the run once again. She tries to figure out where to go, but fear gets the better of her, and she just ends up running straight
forward.

Unfortunately, as is sometimes found in the predator-prey relationships of the animal kingdom, this is by design. The Rat doesn't realize
that she is slowly being cornered.

She hears the methodical footsteps of her pursuer, but she can't tell where they come from. It appears as if the origin of the sound was in her mind,
inside her skull, radiating outwards.

Left.

Right.

Left

Right.

Rat collapses for a moment, she feels like her head is going to split. Left. Right. Left. Right. After a moment, she regains some of her composure
and starts to run again.

Alas, her sprint leads to a dead end. This is why one should pay attention to maps and facts. Not knowing what you get into predicts loss,
preparedness predicts victory.

There is nowhere to run. Rat is terrified. She collapses to the ground and crawls back to the wall. Breathing heavily.

A tall shadowy figure soon appears. Left. Right. He calmly approaches Fira and extends his hand forward.

The man grabs her by the collar and lifts her off the ground. At first, she tries to struggle, but all resistance seems futile.
She can't bite him and clawing on his arm doesn't help, it is covered by a thick black overcoat. She gives up and remains frozen in fear.

And then, he speaks: "A little rat running around in the sewers, how fitting. I'm sorry Fira,
but I can't have you messing around with this place any longer." And as he finished the sentence, he let go of her, and as he did,
the girl disappeared without a trace.

.

.

.

Elsewhere, several days later. It is night, the sky is clear and the moon is full. Thousands of shiny stars silently glimmer. They are pure and far
removed from the troubles of earthly life. A million years ago, they were shining like this, and a million years later, they will still be there. Silently
shining, like tiny eyes, watching the world tirelessly.

The river is flowing north today. It has been many hours since the sun set and, as maybe unexpected of this city ridden with sin, the place where we are
now seems peaceful and quiet.

A naked woman appears. She has black hair, not too long, not too short. Her body is balanced, like the template for a fit female figure, although perhaps
tilted more towards the slim end of the distribution. Her eyes are red and the pupils have the stretch out over the iris in the shape of a triangle that
had its corners cut off.

The only thing on her is a tight black choker, roughly at the center of her neck.

It is not long since she was released from her master, firmly planted in the physical world, and out to do stuff on her own. There was still some adjusting
to do. Regardless, for tonight, she had a clear goal in her mind.

She walked towards the water and stood for a moment, then went in, until the water covered her feet. It was cold and strange. The cold didn't bother her.

She then slowly backed off and went in again, but instead of walking into it, she walked on the surface of water. There was a circle around her,
where the water was perfect still and flattened.

She headed towards the middle of the river, where the water is deepest.

The river started shining and changed color.

The woman still walked towards the depths.

The river started flowing the other direction.

No matter, even this didn't discourage her.

The river changed color and direction.

She finally reached the center, closed her eyes and laid down on to the water.

The river changed color, direction and again color and shone even brighter.

The woman took a deep breath and... sunk.

The river started changing color and direction rapidly, great waves appeared on the surface, it was like
an animal struggling to escape captivity. Like it was squirming on the ground.

This only intensified. The woman had sunk to the bottom already, like if you threw a stone into a pond.
She was squirming and reaching all over herself as well.

In a moment, the river seemed to have all colors at once and no one could tell which direction it was flowing.

Climax. The water stopped moving and turned black. It started getting colder and colder.

Suddenly, the woman rose out of the water, donning a black halter dress with a wide and ornate skirt, reminiscent
to those of ball dresses, but not as large as the ones you can see in baroque reenactments. On the dress,
there were several brooches, each of them was just a gem set into gold with a pin. One for each color of the river.

As she stepped on the surface, the water underneath her bare foot froze, so did the next step and the next.

The ice started spreading from her footsteps, at first slowly, but then faster and faster, until the water was frozen
as far as eye could see.

The red triangular eyes of the lady of the river were shining like two red moons.

She looked up into the sky, waved her hand over her head and said a single word.

_Mugetsu_. No moon. Starless sky. Eternal night.

Then she walked off, towards the nuclear power plant.

# EPISODE 1: HORUS

The man managed to park his truck in the parking lot for trucks and decided it was time to go for a walk and start exploring.

Elsewhere, but close enough, a short girl has just left the train to go to her friend's flat to drop off something for him.

The sun is shining and a cold, wintry breeze is blowing. The girl is absentmindedly walking on the sidewalk. She remembers an
event from a few years ago which changed her life forever. She is unsure why, perhaps it's the trucks that are driving by on
the road.

As it happens, the man is on the other end of the sidewalk. Two strange fellows are about to pass by one another.

There is still a bit of ice on the sidewalk. It's a leftover of snow from a few weeks ago. The winter has been dry indeed.

The nostalgic daydream of the girl doesn't pay off. She trips and falls right in front of the man.

The man, looking about thirty-five, well-built and muscular, brown-haired, with a skin slightly darker than that of a typical white man,
and with piercing blue eyes stops in front of the fallen girl.

He is surprised, but grabs her by her coat and helps her get back on her feet. She growls angrily.

Then the man spoke:

"Howdy, are you alright? My name is Horus, that's H-O-R-U-S, not Horace, some people confuse the two. And you are?"

"I'm Neiro... thanks."

"Glad to meet you, I'm new to this place, so I don't know how stuff works around here yet."

"How did you get in? They don't let people without a resident card in," Neiro responded. Or something like that, I'm still unsure about the way she speaks.
Cartographer insert out.

"I have a business permit. I am a businessman of sorts. I sell light bulbs and I also have another passion. I adore trinkets and oddities and
I trade for them. I heard there is a lot of strange stuff going on around here, so I came over here personally in hopes of finding some interesting
things... Ah, I'm sorry I talk too much. I have been on the road for quite a while."

Neiro commented on how strange Horus's vocation seems to be, but decided to bid him farewell and go on her merry way.

Horus, however, stopped her and added: "Actually, I'm looking for someone to show me around, you know this city, don't you? Would you
be willing to be my guide?"

Neiro shook her head and declined as politely as she could. She felt a little cranky and wasn't in the mood for some strangers.

Horus presented a counter-offer: "I'm paying". He was a pretty successful businessman with a lot of coin to spare.

An image of a wallet full of only cobwebs flashed through Neiro's mind. Maybe she could use a little extra money,
even though she knew she would be broke again quite quickly anyway. Horus looked well kempt and didn't look to Neiro like the type
to go murdering in a dark alley.

"Okay, I will show you some places, but don't expect much. This city is a dangerous shithole. Also don't be weird."

"Alright, you have my word. Where do we go?"

"I have some errands to run."

"That's fine, what place are we visiting first?"

"My friend Valentine's house. I got something for him."

"Would that happen to be one Valentine Erimez?"

"Yes...? Do you know him!?" said Neiro, slightly concerned. The fact that he knows Val's surname shook her a bit.

"No, I don't know him. Not personally, but I have a shipment for him. Actually, let's take a two-minute detour to my truck,
we will pick up the package, and then we can kill two birds with one stone, how about that?" Horus responded.

"Uh, okay. What do you have for him?"

"This might surprise you, but light bulbs. It's not a big package, only six of them. He is one of the three customers
thanks to whom I have been able to enter The City." Horus explained.

"Why would he order light bulbs from you if you are from so far away?" Neiro was still more than slightly suspicious.

"I make light bulbs like no other. I have a wide assortment of illumination devices for all sorts of use-cases.
You'll see in due time."

Strange.

And so, Neiro and Horus took a detour to the truck parking lot. He showed her his truck, it was a bit scary to her,
not just because it was oversized and armored but also because although the color is different and modifications have been
made to it, the cabin looks like the very same truck that appears in the dreams she has every once in a while, the one
that hit her.

Horus tried: "Look at her, this beautiful beast. This is the best truck ever made, it can deliver anything anywhere
and it's protected, there is no safer place than behind this ship's steering wheel."

It did not help.
<div id="alma"></div>
"It's my mobile command center, haha. I have a lot of trinkets, oddities and novelty in it. Surely there will be something in it
you'd like."

"No, let's get out of here."

That was it, then. The two made their way towards Valentine's flat.

Neiro knocked on the door and in a moment, Valentin opened the door. He was a black man, with dark-looking eyes,
about the same height as Horus, slim but definitely fit.

Neiro immediately hugged him. She was very cranky before, but now she was excited to see him.

"Look, what the cat dragged in. I'm glad you came, Nei-rou," said Valentine with a smirk.

"Who is this other guy, N?" he added.

"I'm Horus, I have your light bulb shipment. Ampoules Sans Frontiéres Pvt. Ltd.," responded Horus with French
that sounded more like German.

"Uh, Neiro, this isn't the guy was supposed to make the delivery," said Valentine and readied his hand to grab for his dagger,
if it were necessary.

"That is correct, I'm not your local delivery man. I'm the manufacturer, my company produces these.
We accepted a few orders to The City, so I took the opportunity to visit and see it for myself. Sorry for
the misunderstanding. Here's your light bulbs," replied Horus, handing the box to Valentine.

"Okay, then, thanks."

"Pleased to meet you, like I said, my name is Horus. That's 'US' at the end.". Horus extended his hand to shake
Valentine's.

"I'm Valentine."

Valentine shook Horus, but as he did, Horus squeezed his hand as to not let him go and turned Valentine's hand
knuckles up.

"Fancy tattoos, I have never seen any like these before. Do they carry some deeper meaning?" asked Horus curiously.

"Depends, they have meaning for me," says Valentine, shrugging.

"I understand, well, all I can say is that I dig the skulls," responds Horus with a slight friendly smile.

"We should go," Neiro joins the conversation.

"We will talk later, Neiro. Be careful."

"See you, Val."

Neiro and Horus leave. On the way out, Horus asks:
"I couldn't help but notice that your right eye is in a pretty bad shape. You can't see out of it, can you? What happened?"

"No, I can't and it's a long story," responded Neiro, with a slightly angry undertone.

"I see. If it's any consolation," said Horus, "my right eye doesn't see that well either. In my case, nothing happened. It's
been like that for as long as I can remember. So my eyesight isn't that good, but I try to make up for it by making the most
of what I got, by paying attention to things."

A single "Huh" comes out of Neiro as she takes out a cigarette and a lighter. She puts the cigarette in her mouth.

Lighter open, spark, flame, ignite... wait, what? Where is the cigarette?

Neiro snaps out of it and sees that Horus snatched it.

"These are bad for you, you know?" he exclaims.

"Give it back, are you gonna school me about the dangers of smoking!?" says Neiro angrily.

"No far from it, what I'm saying it, these suck," he responds as he throws it away. "I believe, that quality is preferable."

Horus pulls out the cigar from earlier out of the breast pocket of his trench coat.

"Try this, it's better and less cancer. And of course, it's a novelty. See the writing on the side?"

At this point, it only said "you waiting, huh?", the front of it has been burnt off already, still, there was about two
thirds of it left.

"You know how to use it, right?" asked Horus.

"Yea, what did you think?" Neiro was still a bit hostile, but she snatched the cigar out of Horus's hand.
She was angry, but also curious, since she never smoked a cigar before.

Lighter open, spark, flame, ignite, partake.

Neiro immediately starts coughing and wheezing.

Horus starts laughing: "It seems your prowess has been overstated a bit. You don't inhale a cigar like a cigarette,
you will just start coughing and have a bad time. Also there is ten to fifteen times more tobacco in this than
in a cigarette. Moderation is key."

"Here, imagine that you are pulling in from a straw, that's a good way to think about it. You pull in, you let
it sit for a moment and then you blow it out. But don't do it that often, or the cherry will get too heated and
you will start tasting tar."

"Okay, alright." Neiro was embarassed about her smoking failure.

She tried being more gentle and doing it the way Horus said. It was much better. Unlike the cigarettes, which she
was mostly smoking to take the edge off and to satisfy her addiction, this thing tasted pretty good.
It was actually a pleasant experience. She finally calmed down and daydreamed again.

She pulled in and blew out smoke a few times and then returned to paying attention.

"So.. these light bulbs you are selling, what are they for?" she asked.

"I sell a plenty of types. If you are asking about the ones for Valentine in particular,
those are weed bulbs. They make weed grow better."

If Neiro was drinking coffee right now, she would have spat it out. Unfortunately,
it was just a single cough and a fast exhale: "What?"

"Well, exactly that. They have a specifically calibrated color which emulates just the type of daylight you need
