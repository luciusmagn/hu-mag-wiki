# EPISODE 1: HORUS

Hello, I welcome you, dear listener. On this most auspicious of nights,
let me recount a series of strange events that make a story, one that I
hope will be compelling, even if only a bit.

However, before I begin, I must warn you - I'm a cartographer, not a
writer or a storyteller, I work with maps and factsheets, the telling of
a story, despite being a new hobby of mine, still largely remains an enigma
to me. I cannot accurately convey the feelings, the oddities or the speech
patterns of people I have never met in person. I am still experimenting
with some ways of dramatization, but for the most part, you, dear listener,
will have to read between the lines and infer the feelings and meanings
from context and the data I present.

Nevertheless, I shall try my best to tell a story unlike any I have ever
told before (which all things considered, doesn't set the bar too high).

Our story begins on one snowy day, with the sun shining and a cold, wintry
breeze blowing. Two strange fellows are about to pass by one another on the
sidewalk... Actually, wait, I don't think this is the best place to start.

Scene change.

Our story begins in the damp sewers below the city. The sewers have a complex
layout, as should be expected from a major city. Here's a map- Oh wait, you
can't see it. Well... too bad... you will have to imagine it.

The sewers are a cold and dark place, a fine settings for a predator on
the prowl, just as much as for a prey on the run. The prey seems to be a little
rat, or at least that's what they call her. She is scared and frantically running
away. The predator? A tall shadowy figure, a strange man, without a doubt,
methodically and slowly following the Rat's path.

The Rat is running, but as may often happen in a predator-prey relationship,
doesn't realize it is slowly being cornered. That is why you too, dear listener,
should pay attention to maps and facts. Not knowing what you get into predicts loss,
being prepared predicts victory.

Soon enough, there is nowhere to run. The shadowy figure corners Rat and grabs her by
the collar with his left hand and lifts her off the ground. At first, she tries
to struggle, but resistance seems futile. She gives up and remains frozen in fear.

"A little rat running around in the sewers, how fitting. I'm sorry, Fira,
but I can't have you messing with this place any longer," he said. Then he let go,
and just as he did, the girl disappeared without a trace or a sound.

A mysterious and cryptic beginning, that might work, I suppose. Alright, let's go back
to the wintry street. The sidewalk is covered with snow, but that matters not to
one of the two walking down the street. Neiro Shimohara is elsewhere, in her mind,
reminiscing about the past, a similar street, wrong season, a life-changing event.

This absent-minded episode, however, doesn't seem to pay off in the real life -
Neiro trips and ends up face first in the snow. This piqued the interest of the other
character. A man, looking about thirty-five, slim and tall, brown-haired and with piercing
blue eyes stops in front of the fallen Neiro and puts her back up on her feet.
She growls.

The man exclaims something on the lines of: "Howdy, are you alright? My name is Horus,
that's H-O-R-U-S, not Horace, as some people think. I am new to this place. And you are?"

"My name is Neiro, thanks. How did you get in? They don't let people without a resident card in,"
Neiro responded. Or something like that. I know what she said, but not how she said it,
I'm sorry listener.

"I have a business permit. I am a business man. I sell lightbulbs and I also have another
passion. I adore trinkets and oddities and I trade for them. I heard there is some strange
stuff going on around here, I hope to find some interesting things."

Neiro commented on how strange Horus's vocation seems to be, but decided to bid him
farewell and go on her merry way, whichever one was that supposed to be.

Horus, however, stopped her and said: "Actually, I'm looking for someone to show me around,
you seem to know this place, would you be willing to?"

Neiro apologized and politely declined.

Horus presented a counter-offer: "I'm paying." This was enough to convince an ever-broke Neiro
to abide with his request. "Okay, I will show you around, but please don't be weird. What would
you like to see?"

"I want to see everything, your pick."

"I need to run some errands so follow me and we will see as we go."

While Horus and Neiro are running errands, let's visit a slightly cryptic intermezzo that's
about to happen in the night. But first, my eyes are getting tired, so let me find my
spectacles. It's funny that for all the years of my staring into maps, sheets and schematics,
that I still haven't built up any tolerance for reading without glasses.

Oh boy, where did I put them? Let me check this drawer, or maybe that one? Hmmm. It's
neither one. Huh! I know, they are certainly in this bag. No... that's a shame... Oh, wait a
moment, they are on my head... Heh, well, I'm definitely cutting this out of the recording.

Or not, I want every listener to have an authentic experience. Alright, then, let's get back
into the strange art of storytelling.
